Like many before us we have assembled a horde with warriors and chieftains from every tribe, but this unity will likely be temporary unless we strive for greater unity. We could, as Genghis Khan did, proclaim that all the Mongols are one people, with all division between them made obsolete. Alternatively we could reorganize the tribes, recognizing their distinctiveness but clearly defining their rights and territories."
