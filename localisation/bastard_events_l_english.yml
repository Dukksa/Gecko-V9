 echo.22.t:0 "Faceting"
 echo.22.d:0 "Gem-cutting masters in [diamond_city.GetCapitalName] have made a breakthrough in diamond cutting by experimenting with diamond dust suspended in oil on their scaifs. This is allowing the [Root.GetAdjective] artisans to cut the rare stones in entirely new shapes and to much greater brilliance. The resulting technique, known as faceting, produces a stone of a more pleasing geometric shape and with better optical qualities. As the new stones, and the technique for making them, spread across courts and workshops the demand for jewelry, diamonds and precious stones is increasing greatly."
 echo.22.a:0 "Gems are truly outrageous."
