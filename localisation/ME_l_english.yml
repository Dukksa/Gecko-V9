 # Missions:
 BRA_renaissance_title: "Arrival of Renaissance"
 BRA_renaissance_desc: "The Renaissance, a movement originating from Italy in the 15th century, has not passed by the marches. At the end of the 15th century, the margraves of Brandenburg have begun to pursue a state ruled by law and humanism. As a result, elector Joachim the First has founded Universita Viadrina in 1506. Having also strengthened the rights of the 'Kammergericht' ten years later and instituted the Constitutio Joachimica in 1527, elector Joachim I has established himself as the initiator of renaissance in Brandenburg."
 BRA_privy_council_title: "Privy Council"
 BRA_privy_council_desc: "Our nation requires a more subtle touch compared to the typical council of advisors. A discrete board of the [Root.Monarch.Title]'s closest advisors--the duchy's best and brightest--will ensure that state affairs are handled with efficiency and efficacy."
 BRA_hohenzollerns_in_franconia_title: "Franconian Relatives"
 BRA_hohenzollerns_in_franconia_desc: "Over in the poorish lands of Ansbach lay our dynastic brethren. House Hohenzollern stretches far and wide, though its sure grip on Ansbach presents an opportunity to unite the clans of the House into one unified political entity, if not geographical."
 BRA_hohenzollern_domination_title: "Hohenzollern Domination"
 BRA_hohenzollern_domination_desc: "The prestigious Hohenzollern Dynasty boasts historic claims to the German lands of Franconia, ruling over several counties in the region. For the glory of the House of Hohzenzollern, we should unite the region under the true German crown, the crown that has ruled Brandenburg dutifully for these few decades."
 BRA_neumark_title: "Treaty of Cölln"
 BRA_neumark_desc: "The New Mark of Brandenburg lays in the hands of the militant Prussians. Thankfully, their virulent wars and financial mismanagement give us an opening. We expect that they might simply pawn off the territory to its rightful owners. Should they fail to do so, the Emperor should condone a rightful conquest of the area. The Margraviate shall grow, one way or another."
 BRA_pomerania_title: "Subdue Pommern"
 BRA_pomerania_desc: "Centuries of bitter warfare with the Northern fiends of Pomerania leave us poor whilst they thrive on ill-gotten gains. As they spit upon our name, we have suffered greatly both in honor and dignity. It is our duty to put an end to this northward violence and turmoil. There shall be no escape this time."
 BRA_mecklenburg_title: "End the Hansetage"
 BRA_mecklenburg_desc: "The influence of the Hanseatic League stretches from the far reaches of the Lowlands to the merchants of Riga, all the way inland to our neighbors in Magdeburg. Whilst the alliance is defensive in nature, it presents a threat to the well-being to the Margraviate, both economically and militarily. A threat to even the mighty Kalmar Union, we cannot rest easy while such an influential organization of city-states sleeps next to us."
 BRA_winds_of_reformation_title: "Winds of Reformation"
 BRA_winds_of_reformation_desc: "Long have we toiled under the inquisitive Roman church, sending extortionate dues in the form of tithes. Our brothers and sisters across the Empire throw off the shackles of Rome as we speak. It is our duty as proud Christians to join them in their righteous endeavor of pure faith. The posturing priests of Catholicism know not of the plight of the common man, nor what is right in the eyes of the Lord. Let a man decide on his own his path to salvation; let him read the Good Book!"
 BRA_religious_unity_title: "Cuius Regio Eius Religio"
 BRA_religious_unity_desc: "'Whose Realm, Their Religion.' It is the duty of ruler to determine the path their citizenry must follow, both in earthly matters and those beyond comprehension. A single man cannot sit above the Holy See and know of salvation for each man, woman, and child. A decentralized church is best for all except the Pope, and to that end we shall enforce a new way--a better way. A Brandenburgian way."
 BRA_dominance_in_the_circle_title: "Electoral Dominance"
 BRA_dominance_in_the_circle_desc: "The Saxons represent a militant faction both among the Electors and the Empire as a whole. Though our history with the Duchy has been more or less peaceful, it has been tense at best. And as they say, hope for the best, but prepare for the worst. We cannot be unprepared in the event that this fragile armistice shatters."
 BRA_fate_of_saxony_title: "Fate of Saxony"
 BRA_fate_of_saxony_desc: "We are no strangers to war, nor are the Saxons. They know the rules, and so do we. This fact, however, need not lead to bloodshed. Should we recognize them as brothers and kin, we might yet reach a diplomatic solution. We could represent a fearsome coalition, both in battle and in the Imperial elections, which we hope to one day secure. However, should the need arise, warfare is always a solid backup plan."
 BRA_prussia_title: "Herzogtum Preußen"
 BRA_prussia_desc: "The Hohenzollern Dynasty has always had close ties to the Prussians. Despite our disdain of the Teutons, they are their own worst enemy; indeed, they shall fall in due time. A posthumous duchy shall arise in its place. De Jure law demands it!"
 BRA_prussian_ascendance_title: "Prussian Ascendance"
 BRA_prussian_ascendance_desc: "The Duchy of Prussia, solidified de jure, shall be the core of a new grand power of Europe. Our ambitions betray our stature, but they needn't for long. We possess a spirit unbroken by law or power, impervious to external forces. We are unique in that fact: be us Brandenburg or Prussia."
 BRA_political_dynasty_title: "Political Dynasty"
 BRA_political_dynasty_desc: "The House of Hohzenzollern only recently saw elevation to the international stage of Europe. Securing holdings in Franconia and Brandenburg, we are a fledgling dynasty seeking only to grow and solidify our grip on these Imperial possessions. And so it shall be done through the power of the pen."
 BRA_magdeburg_title: "The Mighty Fortress"
 BRA_magdeburg_desc: "The unshakable Hanseatic city to our south, the Bishopric of Magdeburg, is a stronghold of both religious and mercantile values. Despite this, it sits nestled between Mittlemark and Altmark. Should they get delusions of grandeur, our western flank lays wholly undefended. That being said, perhaps they can provide the solution to that issue..."
 BRA_irontooth_title: "End the Rule of the Nobles"
 BRA_irontooth_desc: "The nobility of the Margraviate has served us rather poorly in recent years. Robber Barons run amok, threatening the foundation of the nation as a whole. They have become an issue that we need to solve, one way or another."
 BRA_burghers_in_check_title: "The Irontooth"
 BRA_burghers_in_check_desc: "The merchant class of Brandenburg openly exploits the peasantry, evades taxes, and defies the Margrave's will. For a stronger and more stable nation, we must curtail the rights of the burghers. The nickname 'The Irontooth' shan't go unheeded."
 BRA_concluding_the_transition_title: "Conclude the Transition"
 BRA_concluding_the_transition_desc: "The transition to Hohenzollern rule has been fraught with turmoil and centralization. Discontent and instability may plague Brandenburg, but it shall all end soon. The transition shall conclude."
 BRA_universita_viadrina_title: "Universita Viadrina"
 BRA_universita_viadrina_desc: "It is the Elector's duty to cultivate an environment of intelligence and culture within the nation, and there is no better method than the establishment of Brandenburg's first university. With the approval of the church, we shall erect a grand institute of learning in the town of Frankfurt an der Oder."
 BRA_kreditwerk_title: "Das Kreditwerk"
 BRA_kreditwerk_desc: "The burden of finance cannot lie solely with the monarch, nor the nobility, nor the merchants. We must create a joint organization under the control of the Elector to ensure sound management of the Margrave's fiscal policy."
 BRA_army_reform_title: "Markische Armeereform"
 BRA_army_reform_desc: "The Margraviate of Brandenburg has always relied heavily on its army. After all, we serve as the Empire's march in the east, defending him from the Polish invaders. This duty has changed over time, but our army has remained alarmingly stagnant, nearly to the point of complacency. This is a dark trend we cannot take for granted... let us call an assembly of generals to ensure modernization of tactics and technology."
 BRA_project_power_title: "Project Power"
 BRA_project_power_desc: "Brandenburg sits nestled in a virulent position between many foreign powers. We must assert ourselves so that we might not end up on the receiving end of such assertion."
 BRA_duchy_of_prussia_title: "Duchy of Prussia"
 BRA_duchy_of_prussia_desc: "" #Similar context to the Treaty of Wehlau event below.
 #Events:
 ME_Prussia_Events.1.t: "Albert of Brandenburg"
 ME_Prussia_Events.1.d: "Following the ascension of his brother to the Electoral seat of Brandenburg, Albert was formally a margrave of Brandenburg, but chose to follow the ecclesiastical path after his studies at the university of Frankfurt. As such when the Archbishop of Magdeburg was a clear goal where he could execute both his divine and familial duties in life. However, when the Archbishop passed away, he had not yet acquired the required age and education for the position. Furthermore, his desired position would hold great influence."
 ME_Prussia_Events.1.a: "Nothing that can't be solved with some money to grease the wheels."
 ME_Prussia_Events.1.b: "You can preach from the local chapel."
 ME_Prussia_Events.2.t: "Papal Investiture"
 ME_Prussia_Events.2.d: "Due to the corrupted influence of the Brandenburgian Margrave, the Holy Father requests the bishop becomes a Hohenzollern prince, Albert"
 ME_Prussia_Events.2.a: "We will honor Pope's requests"
 ME_Prussia_Events.2.b: "The Bishopric is in our hands!"
 ME_Prussia_Events.3.t: "Hohenzollern Kin"
 ME_Prussia_Events.3.d: "Ever since the ascension of Albert, we have had a strong connection to the Hohenzollerns."
 ME_Prussia_Events.3.a: "Hohenzollern shall the bishop be!"
 ME_Prussia_Events.3.b: ""
 ME_Prussia_Events.4.t: "Prince-Archbishopric of Magdeburg"
 ME_Prussia_Events.4.d: "The reformation is in full swing, and the distinction between ecclesiastical and secular is fading in the protestant realms, and the Margraviate of Brandenburg and the Archbishopric of Magdeburg have grown close over time."
 ME_Prussia_Events.4.a: "Let us ask them to unite our realms"
 ME_Prussia_Events.4.b: "Honor the separation of church and state."
 ME_Prussia_Events.5.t: "Union with Brandenburg"

 #Above is Jay's localization
 ME_Prussia_Events.6.t: "Raubritter"
 ME_Prussia_Events.6.d: "Through unscrupulous practices do fiendish folks rise to prominence. The resurgence of Robber Barons has put a horrid streak on the Hohenzollern name, accompanied by the violence and extortionate taxation that the raubritter see fit to impose. The Margraviate's previous efforts to curtail these practices seem to be wearing off. How shall we proceed?" #The early hohenzollern efforts to get rid of robber barons, who were rampant in brandenburg
 ME_Prussia_Events.6.a: "What my Father had started, I shall finish."
 ME_Prussia_Events.6.b: "They will eventually go away."
 ME_Prussia_Events.7.t: "Treaty of Prenzlau"
 ME_Prussia_Events.7.d: "The centuries of warfare with Pomerania have come to an end. With the ratification of the Treaty of Prenzlau, Emperor [Emperor.GetName] has affirmed our de jure right to the conquest of the fertile lands of Pommern. As such, the integration of Uckermark, as well as the rest of the Duchy, shall begin." #https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Prenzlau
 ME_Prussia_Events.7.a: "The duchy of Pomerania is ours!"
 ME_Prussia_Events.7.b: "Perhaps a later draft will do us better."
 ME_Prussia_Events.8.t: "Supporting the Kinsmen"
 ME_Prussia_Events.8.d: "The Hohenzollern family, despite our recent rise to power, has considerable land holdings to the south, in the County of Ansbach. A poor, undeveloped land, it represents not only a familial link to Central Germany, but also an opportunity to establish our influence further into the Empire. It would be remiss of us to pass up this chance." #Supporting hohenzollerns in franconia
 ME_Prussia_Events.8.a: "United we stand!"
 ME_Prussia_Events.8.b: "Brandenburg is the future of the Hohenzollerns."
 ME_Prussia_Events.9.t: "Returning the Favor"
 ME_Prussia_Events.9.d: "A ducal party has arrived professing our northward dynastic allies' belief in our success and future, not as Franconians, but as carriers of the Hohenzollern legacy. Brandenburg is surely the more powerful entity and could certainly provide ample protection to us in our time of need. They have offered to support our state for the time being; how shall we proceed?" #the event for franconians when the Prussians do the mission
 ME_Prussia_Events.9.a: "We'll closely cooperate with our family."
 ME_Prussia_Events.9.b: "We need but repay the favor."
 ME_Prussia_Events.9.c: "Indebting ourselves to them would be silly."
 ME_Prussia_Events.10.t: "Berliner Religiongesprach"
 ME_Prussia_Events.10.d: "Numerous theologians and scholars have all gathered in Berlin for a once in a lifetime event. The topic is simple: reconciling the differences of Lutheran and Calvinist theology. We have long since been a bastion of religious freedom in the Empire, providing refuge to those targeted by the Inquisition. Despite this, tensions continue to rise as the people take sides in what has become a Protestant Schism, akin to the splitting of the Roman Church. Hopefully, with this conference there will be peace." #https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berliner_Religionsgespr%C3%A4ch
 ME_Prussia_Events.10.a: "A Great Development!"
 ME_Prussia_Events.10.b: "The churches can't be united. Waste of time!"
 ME_Prussia_Events.11.t: "Der Toleranzedikt"
 ME_Prussia_Events.11.d: "As religious tensions grow, it is Brandenburg's job to stifle the ever-growing flame and weather the storm ahead. The Edict of Tolerance, issued by Elector Friedrich Wilhelm I, stated that the Lutheran and Reformed Churches are to be treated as equals and the relations between them are to be regulated by law." #https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toleranzedikt_(Brandenburg)
 ME_Prussia_Events.11.a: "Force the Edict!"
 ME_Prussia_Events.11.b: "This will only create more discontent."
 ME_Prussia_Events.12.t: "Die Zwei Akademien"
 ME_Prussia_Events.12.d: "With the rise of intellectual pursuits in the Margraviate, we have seen the rise of two main universities. One is for the study and research of Arts, whilst the other focuses on the natural sciences of the world. Which shall see our patronage?" #contrast below

 ME_Prussia_Events.13.d: ""Schlosskirche", literally Castle Church, was a church constructed in Königsberg, whose splendor was given to it by work that began in 1584. It was here, that in 1701, Elector Frederick III of Brandenburg, founded the Order of the Black Eagle. The following day he crowned himself as a King in Prussia. This began the tradition of coronating the Prussian Kings in the church, a tradition that would devour much of Prussian treasury, for those were usually lavish and full of splendour."

The West Slavs of Silesia inherently break the homogeny of the Prussian lands. This colonization could present ample opportunity to fix this."  #The State of Prussia sent many german settlers into prussia.

We might be able to squeeze a bit more money out of the populace through an additional excise tax." #a toll on beer

 ME_Prussia_Events.24.t: "The End of the French Influence"
 ME_Prussia_Events.24.d: "In the days of old, France and Holy Roman Empire were a single state ruled by the Francian Kings. Unfortunately, all things, good or bad, come to an end. The Treaty of Verdun has seen the Frankish Empire splinter into three states, two of which would later become France and the Holy Roman Empire. It is why, France, the western neighbour of the Holy Roman Empire, has, since time immemorial, been influencing the western princes. Their influence can not only be seen in the culture, but also in their 'patronage' of enforcing the 1648's Treaty of Westphalia. This influence is, more often than not, hampering the unification of the German Peoples. Fortunately, the rising state in Prussia has decided to put an end to the French influence and has finally abased the French, preventing them from further influencing the german cities."
 ME_Prussia_Events.24.a: "Scourge of the West is defeated."

 ME_Prussia_Events.25.d.1: "Holy Roman Empire is an entity that dates back almost a thousand years. Since then, it has undergone many changes in administration, centralization and army organization, oftentimes in vain. Despite these changes, the slow decay of the imperial power has not halted. The apparent state of weakness displayed by the Empire has only been reinforced by the glorious campaign lead by us against the forces of the Emperor. Having been humiliated by catastrophic losses, the imperial authority is but a shell of its former self. This proves once and for all, that the emperor is not fit for protecting the Germans. About time the german princes realized that only the Prussian crown may offer them certain independence."
 ME_Prussia_Events.25.d.2: "Holy Roman Empire is an entity that dates back almost a thousand years. Since then, it has undergone many changes in administration, centralization and army organization, oftentimes in vain. Despite these changes, the slow decay of the imperial power has not halted.

No more shall our brethren tremble in fear of the imperial enemies!"
 ME_Prussia_Events.25.d.3: "Holy Roman Empire was an entity that dated back almost a thousand years. Since then, it has undergone many changes in administration, centralization and army organization, oftentimes in vain. Despite these changes, the slow decay of the imperial power has not halted. At last, the Holy Roman Empire is no more. Dismantled not just by foreign aggression, but also by internal strife, it finally met its end. As such, the German People remain splintered among many weak states that are prone to a quick  end by the hands of german enemies. It is high time Prussia took the initiative and became the defender of the German citizens."

A sound that usually coincides with despair bears fruit as the backbone of our great nation, spurred on by the cheers of men and women emboldened by such raw might. Never has the world bore witness to such a display, never has the world seen one such as Great Prussia. Yet, as the boots stomp on, we begin to ponder: what for? What is a rifle without a man, what is a conquest without a purpose? A nation such as ours needs not ponder such a proposal, for our justification is self-evident. We are the rulers of the Germans, through gunfire or the stroke of a pen. In the end, it is not a matter of ends, but rather means; it is a matter of Prussia's legacy. Are we to continue marching, forever into the sunrise of a new Empire? Or are we to usher in a new era of prominence and peace?" #restructure this to talk poetically on what prussia could be, a militaristic conqueror of germany, or benevolent lord of the german princes

Before the time of pragmatism, simple solutions were key to the administration of nations, and the Kreditwerk is a remnant of such an era.

First the Teutons, now the Polish, but with finality we might yet proclaim them free. Free from the centuries of oppression the Prussian people have faced. Benevolence is synonymous with our governance, thus we shall take the duchy under our wing if given the opportunity. Signed in 1657 between Brandenburg and Prussia, the Treaty of Wehlau achieved just this: liberation of the Duchy of Prussia from the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and its firm placement under the control of Brandenburg." #Try to add some historical context, but also fit it into the eu4 perspective of a duchy of prussia subject, and trying to free it from polish influence

Wilhelm von Humboldt, the older brother, focused his studies on the philisophical pursuits of life, presenting himself as an intellectual through and through. Meanwhile, his younger brother Alexander von Humboldt focused his studies on incurring one revolutionary discovery after another. Launching several expeditions into Spanish America, Russia, and the United States, the Humboldt brothers were truly a pair of geniuses." #https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_von_Humboldt

Among his policies was the promotion of art within glassmaking. Under his rule, glass manufactures were constructed in Potsdam. Those would make crystal comparable to the one made in Italy and Bohemia, and one that would shine as an example of Baroque art."

 ME_Ducal_Prussia_Events.1.d: "After the defeat of the Teutonic Order, the people there have been becoming more tolerant towards us and the people of Lithuania. In fact, the nobles there wish to cooperate with us if we give them autonomy by establishing the Duchy of Prussia under the rule of a local noble that swears allegiance to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of [Root.GetName]."

 # Missions:
 ENG_Hundred_Years_war_title: "The Hundred Years' War"
 ENG_Hundred_Years_war_desc: "The Treaty of Tours has brought an uneasy period of truce between us and the French. Both sides keep their forces mobilized at all times. It is obvious the truce will not stand the test of time."
 ENG_Scotland_title: "Safety of the Isle"
 ENG_Scotland_desc: "Before going campaigning on the mainland, firstly we are bound to protect the citizens of our home isle. It is only when their safety is ensured that we can organize an expedition to capture the French Throne. This exact safety of our citizenry may soon be disturbed with the Scottish efforts to renew the Auld Alliance. While we cannot be entirely sure whether the Scots would accept a French call-to-arms or not, [Root.Monarch.GetName] must make a move to secure our flank."
 ENG_Poitou_title: "Poitou Fortress"
 ENG_Poitou_desc: "On our path to capture the southern French provinces lies a towering castle in the proximity of Poitiers. As many previous wars have shown, such castles often become center of raiding parties meant to harass armies passing by. As such, it is our foremost mission to bring this french bastion to its knees. Just like the English army humiliated the French forces in 1356, the English army shall do so again."
 ENG_Angevin_Possesions_title: "City of Anjou"
 ENG_Angevin_Possesions_desc: "In the vicinity of the Maine lies the city of Anjou, the mighty capital of the Provencal branch of the Valois. Adding to the injury is the fact that the previously mentioned dynasty is allied to the French branch of the Valois which means that if the [Pro.MonarchGetName] is to honor their alliance, Angevin territory will prove to be a thorn in our side. It is crucial for our war efforts to eliminate this obstacle."
 ENG_Reclaim_Maine_title: "Reclaim Maine"
 ENG_Reclaim_Maine_desc: "In an effort to maintain control of the Maine, we attempted to bring to question the legitimacy of William de la Pole's negotiations. It became quite clear that our desperate attempts at keeping the province were poorly executed, as they resulted in the personal capture of Maine by the French King. Now, with the Hundred Years' War back in motion, it is time to recapture our city. [Root.Monarch.GetName] shall not be remembered as the king who lost Maine, but as the man who brought it back."
 ENG_Chartres_title: "Castle of Chartres"
 ENG_Chartres_desc: "On our way to the Paris exists a formidable fortress in Chartres, one that cannot be ignored during our march. It is certain that a victory in Paris cannot be achieved if we are to let this fort just stand there without a disturbance. It is of utmost importance for us to lay a siege to the castle and capture it in the name of [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 ENG_Paris_title: "Pearl of the West"
 ENG_Paris_desc: "At last, we have arrived at the gates of the grand city of the west - Paris. Captured previously by us in 1420. Since then, the French managed to liberate the city from our hands, and while that act may have boosted their morale greatly, we must prove them that it even their efforts to defeat us are in vain. Our recapture of the city shall be a great blow to them."
 ENG_Regional_control_title: "Control of the North"
 ENG_Regional_control_desc: "The northern areas of France are truly the core territory of the French realm. If we are to take hold of the north, then the loss for the French seems inevitable. Once the north is secured, the last bastion of the French King will become the south, which, while more defensive, will not stop the English onslaught."
 ENG_Path_to_victory_title: "Path to Victory"
 ENG_Path_to_victory_desc: "With the Northern France under our control and the gates of South open, the victory of the French seems far more improbable than ever. If we are to defeat the French more decisively, then we will truly be on the path to victory."
 ENG_Enforce_the_Union_title: "Enforce the Union"
 ENG_Enforce_the_Union_desc: "With our recent victories, it is high time to force the French King to get on his knees and hand over his crown to [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Many will talk about this great victory for years to come."
 ENG_war_of_the_roses_title: "War of the Roses"
 ENG_war_of_the_roses_desc: "The crippling incompetence of Henry VI has led to whole factions trying to exploit him to exert control over the English Realm. These conflicts had resulted in two major factions being born - the faction of York represented by white rose and the faction of Lancaster represented by red rose. Both of these factions are struggling for control over the throne and a civil war seems imminent. We need to deal with it swiftly, whether it means preventing it or surviving it."
 ENG_demands_of_the_peasants_title: "Appease the Peasantry"
 ENG_demands_of_the_peasants_desc: "The peasants led by the so-called 'Jack Cade' have created a written manifesto under the name 'The Complaint of the Poor Commons of Kent'. In the manifesto, Cade's men accuse the crown of extorsion, perversion of justice and election fraud. Our spymaster also reports that Jack has a hefty amount of men at his disposal that he is not afraid to use to capture London with. We must deal with this threat, either by appeasing the peasants or by defeating them in battle."
 ENG_recover_from_the_great_slump_title: "End the Great Slump"
 ENG_recover_from_the_great_slump_desc: "Multiple harvest failures in the previous decades have ruined the economies of countless countries. To add to the injury, shortages of silver in Northern Europe have led to the breakdown of trade - the driving factor of our economy. It is crucial we end this commercial downturn as soon as possible."
 ENG_improve_taxation_title: "Improve Taxation"
 ENG_improve_taxation_desc: "With the Wars of the Roses and Hundred Years' War over, English Economy is in shambles. To combat this, we must establish ruthlessly effective taxation. 'Those nobles who spent little must have saved much, and thus they could afford the increased taxes; on the other hand, those nobles who spent much obviously had the means to pay the increased taxes.'"
 ENG_legitimate_king_title: "Legitimate King"
 ENG_legitimate_king_desc: "With the dreadful tragedies of the 15th century, such as the Great Slump and Wars of the Roses, came an uneasy time for the English Monarchy. People of all classes are displeased, as they firmly believe [Root.Monarch.GetName] won't be able to keep peace for long and that a second War of the Roses is upon us. Our beloved monarch must once again get in favour with the populace."
 ENG_a_new_religion_title: "A New Religion?"
 ENG_a_new_religion_desc: "With the policy of selling indulgences the church has been practising, it seemed inevitable that another heretic movement would have sprung up sooner or later. To nobody's surprise, the predictions were true and one of the monks has very openly described his discontent with the church paving the path for new the 'Reformation'. At the same time, the Pope is still refusing to give [Root.Monarch.GetName], so perhaps it's to defy the Papal Bull and to accept the teachings of the Reformators?"
 ENG_control_state_religion_title: "Control State Religion"
 ENG_control_state_religion_desc: "The general populace is refusing to convert to the new denomination of ours. Simultaneously, the King has not yet used full extent of his powers to promote the new faith among the people. Perhaps, it is the right time for the King to control state religion?"
 ENG_curb_down_the_unrest_title: "End the Unrest"
 ENG_curb_down_the_unrest_desc: "With new religions come religious strifes and turmoil. Our realm is no exception, as there are many counties where the new and the old clash in a violent fight. We must make sure the new has a clear path, which is why we need to curb down all rebellions and unrest, even if it means killing the people of our kind who rise up in rebellions."
 ENG_entrench_the_faith_title: "Entrench the Faith"
 ENG_entrench_the_faith_desc: "In history, religions have managed to split entire nationalities in half. We, of course, cannot let this happen and so we shall make '[Root.Religion.GetName] synonymous to [Root.Culture.GetName]."
 ENG_rival_the_nobles_title: "Rival the Nobles"
 ENG_rival_the_nobles_desc: "As we exhaust our troops on the battlefield, the nobles rake in tax money, abusing their privileges and their serfs as if mere jests. We cannot stand to let these corrupt bastards grow in power only to use it in such a manner. We must create a force to rival their private levies to ensure their cooperation."
 ENG_conquer_scotland_title: "Status of Scotland"
 ENG_conquer_scotland_desc: "These border skirmishes with the Scots have persisted long enough. They are but pawns in our grand chessboard; they cannot dare oppose us now. We shan't waste a single moment in fully occupying them."
 ENG_church_of_scotland_title: "Church of Scotland"
 ENG_church_of_scotland_desc: "The word of reformation has spread not only to us, but also to the Scottish who managed to form a church of their own. We must integrate this church into the Anglican tradition to further integrate the Scottish lands into our realm."
 ENG_conquer_brittany_title: "Conquer Brittany"
 ENG_conquer_brittany_desc: "Now, with the [Root.Monarch.GetName] restored back to the French throne, we have a plethora of lands to govern beyond the seas. In the rear of these lands lies the petit peninsula of the Bretons, the descendants of the people that lived on our isle many centuries ago. If they are not brought under our boot, they can prove to be a thorn in our side."
 ENG_seize_picardy_title: "Seize Picardy"
 ENG_seize_picardy_desc: "The English influence stretches from the Silver Coast up to the Norman waters. And while it is a truly a glorious feat to be had, it can stretch even further if we capture the coastal cities of Picardy"
 ENG_defeat_the_clans_title: "Defeat the Clans"
 ENG_defeat_the_clans_desc: "When we conquered the Scottish Lowlands, the Scottish King fled to the north, seeking refuge in his northern subjects. While, we have defeated the Scottish King once, he won't refrain from sending raiding parties from the green hills of the north. We must defeat him once again and his northern clans."
 ENG_seize_the_isles_title: "Seize the Isles"
 ENG_seize_the_isles_desc: "The unfathomable depths of the North Sea host many a cod for our delectable appetites. One would think the coastal waters of Britain would be enough, however this is not the case. The Faroe Islands, mere sprinkles of the sea, manage to outcompete our grand nation in surrounding waters, which is purely disgusting. We cannot let these mere fisherman best us."
 ENG_statute_of_westmister_title: "Statute of Westminster"
 ENG_statute_of_westmister_desc: "The Longbows are truly powerful, but we can't keep training forever. These powerful weapons require yew wood for manufactoring, which will eventually run short. To combat this, we may need to introduce a special tax for ships coming to our ports that will force them to carry four bowstaves per tun."
 ENG_ireland_title: "Kingdom of Ireland"
 ENG_ireland_desc: "In the year of our lord, 1155, Pope Adrian IV has issued that the English Kings are to be the 'Lords of Ireland' and have full permission to invade Ireland and bring Hibernia under European sphere of Influence. This means we have full right to subjugate this island and create the title of the Irish Kingdom."
 ENG_church_of_ireland_title: "Church of Ireland"
 ENG_church_of_ireland_desc: "Just like we have created the Church of England, we shall do the same to Ireland. Such institution would help us integrate the Irish into the government and bring them closer culturally to the inhabitants of the Eastern Isle."
 GBR_north_sea_trade_dominance_title: "Trade Dominance"
 GBR_north_sea_trade_dominance_desc: "While wealth of nations comes from many sources, our nation's economy is fueled mostly by trade. Coincidentally, trade can also be used as a political tool. If we become the domineering trading power in the North Sea, we will be able to exert more influence on the local nations."
 GBR_Peace_in_ireland_title: "Peace for Iceland"
 GBR_Peace_in_ireland_desc: "Hosts of cod sprinkle the sea, cod we must have. The Nordic tribes of Iceland field great hosts of cod, yet nearly no soldiers. They will fall victim to other imperialist scum if we do not incorporate them first, for their cod is the greatest temptation."
 GBR_naval_dominance_in_north_seas_title: "North Sea Dominance"
 GBR_naval_dominance_in_north_seas_desc: "With our beloved isle united, it is time we look into expansion opportunities overseas. One of the areas we can invade are the North Sea Islands and the land of vikings - Scandinavia. Yet, if we want to invade either of these, we need to gain a naval dominance to protect our invasion from being ruined."
 GBR_invade_norway_title: "Invade Norway"
 GBR_invade_norway_desc: "The Nature of Norwegian Traders causes the northern wealth to be retained in the North Sea, rather than moved into our coffers. If we are to be profiting, we need to remove this obstacle, even if it means a violent war overseas."
 # GBR_white_sea_contracts_title: "White Sea Contracts"
 # GBR_white_sea_contracts_desc: "Removed Missions"
 GBR_north_sea_empire_title: "North Sea Empire"
 GBR_north_sea_empire_desc: "Once upon a time, there was a large realm that indisputably ruled the North Sea. That state was the domain of Cnut the Great who had Denmark, England and Norway under his rule. It's time to bring this state back under the leadership of [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 # GBR_surrender_and_regrant_title: "Surrender and Regrant"
 # GBR_surrender_and_regrant_desc: "Removed Mission"
 GBR_Irish_parliament_title: "Irish Parliament"
 GBR_Irish_parliament_desc: "Currently, our actions in Ireland seem illegitimate to the local populace. We can of course change that if we give the Irish provinces some representation in the Parliament. Such institution would be controlled by us, of course."
 GBR_Irish_plantations_title: "Plantations of Ireland"
 GBR_Irish_plantations_desc: "Integrating Ireland is proving a more difficult than expected. In this case, we must use a different kind of strategy: colonization. We shall confiscate the Irish lands and give them to settlers of our own. These planters will populate the Plantations of Ireland. Delightfully devilish."
 ENG_importance_of_wool_title: "Importance of Wool"
 ENG_importance_of_wool_desc: "The great Flemish artisans weave their cloth from our yarn, and this relationship has led us to be unmatched in quantity and quality in production. Wool is as important to us as cloth is to Flanders or Salt is to The Hansa. That exact importance is greatly reflected in our cultural heritage via idioms or monuments. 'I thank God and ever shall, it was the sheep that payed for all.'"
 ENG_trade_treaty_title: "Flemish Treaty"
 ENG_trade_treaty_desc: "It is high time to renew some of our Flemish trade treaties of old. Our wool and their cloth make an excellent connection on the markets of the war. As a result of previous trade treaties, many Flemish weavers started immigrating and setting up business all over England. They often took the surname 'Fleming' and their legacy is still within England. Let us tend the traditions of old."
 ENG_dutch_deal_title: "Trade Fleet"
 ENG_dutch_deal_desc: "A natural way to expand our trade sector is of course increasing the amount of merchant ships we posess. Currently, the amount we have is pathetic, at most. With this in mind, our next mission shall be to expand the trade fleet."
 ENG_markets_of_england_title: "Markets of England"
 ENG_markets_of_england_desc: "Trade to us is truly important as it accounts for roughly 40% of pur income. Due to this, the government has always deeply cared for the merchants of our nation. This century is, of course, no exception. Even in these decades of war and turmoil we shall support the trading class by building new exchange locations."
 ENG_monopolize_the_channel_title: "Monopolize the Channel"
 ENG_monopolize_the_channel_desc: "In this cruel world, we find ourselves surrounded on all sides by potential foes. These unknown enemies may very well scheme against us, whether it be militarily or diplomatically. One of these ways is of course leeching away from our main source of income: trade. Due to this, we need to monopolize the Channel's resources to our advantage."
 ENG_naval_power_title: "Naval Power"
 ENG_naval_power_desc: "Setting up overseas colonies or raiding foreign treasure fleets require a massive armada that can put pressure on colonial empires. Our current geopolitical situation gifts us with a long and developed coastline that is perfect for shipkeeping. It would be a waste not to increase the strength of our navy and send our most skilled admirals on privateer missions."
 ENG_seize_gibraltar_title: "Seize Gibraltar"
 ENG_seize_gibraltar_desc: "According to all known laws of seafaring, a ship is not able to to sail forever. The [Root.GetAdjective] ships of course abide these rules and so we, the skilled sailors that we truly are, know that that all boats can sail for limited time. Due to this, navies need to resupply every now and then. As a result of this, major stations focused around maintaining and supplying ships have sprung up. We most commonly refer to them as ports. And as we are trying to extend our naval reach, we need to acquire these safe havens for our ships if we are to rule the waves. One particular port that would serve great under the British command is the port of Gibraltar."
 GBR_mediterranean_islands_title: "Mediterranean Bases"
 GBR_mediterranean_islands_desc: "As we grow larger, so does our influence. Proportionally, the extent of our missions do too. To accommodate this exact growth we need not wait with expansion. To extend the naval reach in the Mediterranean world, we ought to get more havens to hoist our proud flag."
 GBR_conquer_egypt_title: "Granary of the Mediterranean"
 GBR_conquer_egypt_desc: "Most of the Colonial powers have already establish many factories along the African Coast. Meanwhile, few, if any, have established trading outposts on the northern part of the continent. A new brave world full of new opportunities lays open there. Due to this, it is high time we start venturing into the rich valley of the Nile."
 ENG_sabotage_colonizers_title: "Sabotage Caribbean"
 ENG_sabotage_colonizers_desc: "Had we known earlier about the riches of the New World, then perhaps we would be all the richer for it. The tales of brave Iberian Conquistadores spread far and wide due to the immense prestige they disclosed. Many smaller states have tried to explore the New Continent and find the Cities of Gold, but we've found a much less costly way of exploiting New World's wealth. The so-called 'Privateers' privately hired by us are serving our nation great by seizing foreign wealth and subsidizing the crown with it; we must make a fair use of them."
 ENG_english_exploration_title: "English Exploration"
 ENG_english_exploration_desc: "With the development of early Carracks and Caravels so came the age of exploration. In the eve of the 15th century, the Iberian explorers have gotten famous thanks to their discovery of a completely new continent. Consequently, plans to sail west were developed in England, but were eventually dropped due to inconvenient trade winds. Yet now, with the development of more modern naval tools, we are now able to conduct expeditions of our own."
 GBR_sun_never_sets_title: "Sun Shall Not Set"
 GBR_sun_never_sets_desc: "The nations, not so blest as thee,\nMust, in their turns, to tyrants fall;\nWhile thou shalt flourish great and free,\nThe dread and envy of them all.\nStill more majestic shalt thou rise,\nMore dreadful, from each foreign stroke;\nAs the loud blast that tears the skies,\nServes but to root thy native oak.\nThee haughty tyrants ne'er shall tame:\nAll their attempts to bend thee down,\nWill but arouse thy generous flame;\nBut work their woe, and thy renown."
 ENG_colony_in_newfoundland_title: "Colony in Newfoundland"
 ENG_colony_in_newfoundland_desc: "While we have discovered much more than the 'Newfoundland', we have to start off simple. We haven't really sent any colonists on a mission yet, so settling in the close proximity to Britain that Newfoundland provides would be ideal for us. Furthermore, the island is surrounded with bodies of water that contain many fishes, especially cods."
 ENG_hudson_Bay_title: "Rupert's Land"
 ENG_hudson_Bay_desc: "As a global empire, we owe much to the ships that we sail on. These machines that let us travel hundreds of kilometres with ease of course need constant maintenance expansion. The most important resource for shipbuilding is timber, of course, which, though an easy resource to come by, is still required in massive amounts."
 ENG_royal_canada_title: "Royal Canada"
 ENG_royal_canada_desc: "Canada supplies The Isles with many crucial resources: fur, most commonly used in the clothing industry; timber, used for shipbuilding; and most importantly - manpower, the amount of men that can be pressed into service in our armies that will help us further expand beyond our borders."
 ENG_thirteen_colonies_title: "Thirteen Colonies"
 ENG_thirteen_colonies_desc: "With our foothold firmly established in the New World, we are now able to venture southward, into much more consoling climates. Besides that, it's time to show the world that [Root.Country.GetName] can establish a large, lasting colony and become the Colonial Empire it aims to be."
 GBR_beyond_appalachian_title: "American Trade"
 GBR_beyond_appalachian_desc: "During our previous missions to the new world we have learned of many local resources. And, as per human nature, we arrived here seeking gold, whether it would be gold that can be acquired raw of via the use of trade. And it must be noted, that we located our settlers in the right position to start a massive colony that would produce exotic goods for us."
 GBR_fair_taxation_title: "Fair Taxation"
 GBR_fair_taxation_desc: "The American Colonists really are a rebellious bunch. Actions to put out their enthusiasm ought to be done sooner or later as tensions in the colonies continue to rise without an end in sight. We need to extinguish their fire and tread on them, if necessary."
 ENG_intervene_in_caribbean_title: "Intervene in Caribbean"
 ENG_intervene_in_caribbean_desc: "Foreign powers have already established their cities along the chain of the Caribbean Archipelago. Unless we intervene in their schemes, they will be able to steer all the wealth from the Spanish Main up to Sevilla with no regard for the merchants of the Chesapeake Coast. This cannot be tolerated."
 ENG_jamaican_colony_title: "British West Indies"
 ENG_jamaican_colony_desc: "Had we known earlier of the riches Central America holds, we would undeniably have tried to contest the Spanish superiority in the Central America. However, at this point not much can be done. Though we may try to snatch a few coastal cities from them, massive invasion is out of the question."
 ENG_ivory_coast_title: "Coast of Ivory"
 ENG_ivory_coast_desc: "Legends speak of a faraway land in the east, full of riches and glory. That land is India, and due to the amazing work of Iberian Explorers, a waterway to it has been conceived. With this newly discovered route, for once doth the trade around Africa flourish. We must make  use of the trend that is happening and establish factories of our own."

 ENG_onto_the_Cape_desc: "With our settlements in Africa came in an influx of entrepreneurs and merchants who wished to exploit the discovery of the route to their advantage. It has become a daily sight of [Root.Adjective.GetName] ships passing by the factories of ours. Yet, with countless safe havens along the coast, sailing to and back from India is still a dangerous business to be had. As a result of many pirate raids and ship castaways, the East India Company has requested we set up a colony in the Cape of Good Hope, which is perfect spot for a haven due to the terrain it lays on."
 GBR_interior_title: "The Interior"
 GBR_interior_desc: "With the growth of Cape Colony came in an onslaught of adventurers. Of course, these men desired one thing only - gold. They have found exactly what they were looking for, alongside many other materials that sell well on the global markets. Currently, the area is infested with private mines of aforementioned entrepreneurs, though they lay under no protection whatsoever. It certainly would be worthy for the crown to establish a formal colony in these areas."
 ENG_indian_company_title: "Indian Company"
 ENG_indian_company_desc: "The East India Trade Company makes its profits by sailing with armadas of ships to the indies, buying goods on the local markets and bringing them back to Europe, where they are sold for profit. Sadly, a lot of the profit is lost due to the taxes that are taken by Indian Powers of ports of their own. If we are to secure several Indian Ports for our Trade Company though, we will be able to remove the middleman and gain more profits, at the same time keeping the Companies happy with the current government."

 ENG_penal_colony_desc: "The hypothesis of a massive Terra Australis continent has been partially confirmed with the expeditions of Lieutenant James Cook.

 GBR_aden_company_title: "Aden Company"

Soon after its founding, this city quickly rose to the status of an entrepot while eclipsing all of the trade centers of the region. This allowed Malacca to become The center of malayan life and culture. We must either capture Malacca or acquire a city that can rival it under our benevolent rule."
 GBR_british_malaya_title: "British Malaya"
 GBR_british_malaya_desc: "Due to the placement of the Region, ships travelling from Cathay and Spice Islands usually pass through the straits Malaya offers.

 GBR_spice_must_flow_desc: "Spices are a commodity only the richest may afford. Yet, on the markets of the East, that luxury is relatively cheap. This exact fact must be exploited to our advantage and so the Spice Islands are due for a conquest."
 GBR_bengal_title: "Kingdom of Bengal"
 GBR_bengal_desc: "The riches of India are to be reckoned with. Our colonial ambitions grow overtime and with expectations rising, question of Indian wealth is asked once again.

 GBR_coromandel_title: "Coromandel State"
 GBR_coromandel_desc: "The deed is done. Our conquest of India has officially begun. While our conquest mostly encompassed the wealthiest region of India, it did not include all that is prosperous. We must expand our control along the coast. After we have conquered Bengal, some of the indian tribes realized the threat that is upon them and now united against us, but as long as we expand slowly, their differences won't allow them to stop us."
 GBR_along_the_rivers_title: "Along the River"

 ENG_manufactories_title: "Manufactories"
 ENG_manufactories_desc: "Back in the 15th century, nobody expected there would be an improvement over the workshops. Everyone firmly believed that it was the peak technological advancement. Yet, they were wrong. Once again innovation knocks on our door and presents a way of productivity never seen before. We need to embrace the new ways and start the early industrialization."
 ENG_naval_infrastructure_title: "Naval Infrastructure"
 ENG_naval_infrastructure_desc: "As a primarily coastal nation, navy is highly valuable to us. While disregarded by many, fleets do, indeed, win wars.

 GBR_plymouth_title: "Plymouth"
 GBR_plymouth_desc: "While Portsmouth is the largest dockyard currently, a growing navy needs more than one port to function properly. That's why Plymouth, or rather HMS Devonport, has been chosen to take the honorary place as the second port of the English state. It's strategic position resembles Portsmouth, but unlike the former, it is closer to the New World which helps in quicker response time."

 # Events:
 ME_England_Events.1.t: "Maine Reclaimed"
 ME_England_Events.1.d: "Ever since the French have captured the city, the English Loyalists have stayed in hiding to avoid persecution by the French. However, on this blessed day, the aforementioned men are able to go out of hiding and finally be free to express their loyalty to us. The mentioned men formed a mob that is currently welcoming our forces into the city of Maine. Lots of the men want to commit to the war effort and boost our dwindling manpower reserves."
 ME_England_Events.1.a: "Forward, to glory!"
 ME_England_Events.2.t: "The Second Treaty of Tours"
 ME_England_Events.2.d: "At last, we are victorious. The war that lasted a hundred years is finally over. Alas, many have lost their lives, both civilians and soldiers. Villages were burned, cities were sacked, lands of France - devastated. But now, the war is finally over. Order has been restored to the French Lands, a new order. The French Kingdom lies at our mercy. It is time for the second Treaty of Tours."
 ME_England_Events.2.a: "We must focus on the continental affairs."
 ME_England_Events.2.b: "This kingdom will make a fine addition to my collection."
 ME_England_Events.3.t: "Jack Cade's Rebellion"
 ME_England_Events.3.d: "Angered by the events of the Hundred Years' War and the taxes that came with it, peasants have risen up in a rebellion against the government as we could not cope with their demands. The rebels claim that the current regime is corrupt and the king's court is abusing its powers. Inspired by previous rebellions, the peasantry of Sussex and Kent have risen up in a revolt against the government and are now on the march to seize London."
 ME_England_Events.3.a: "Damn Them!"
 ME_England_Events.4.t: "Book of Common Prayer"
 ME_England_Events.4.d: "To aid in clerical influence over the commonfolk, [Root.Monarch.GetName] and his council of advisors have come up with the novel idea to introduce a special compendium of ceremonies and prayer that would help to induce religious unity across the nation's innumerable churches. In all English lands, the 'Book of Common Prayer' is to be as the standard of faith and ceremony, effectively pairing with the dissolution of monasteries to assert religious unity and control over the people. One question remains as to the nature of this introduction: to what degree shall we rush to spread this compendium?"
 ME_England_Events.4.a: "Gradual introduction will serve us best"
 ME_England_Events.4.b: "The faster, the better!"
 ME_England_Events.5.t: "Pilgrimage of Grace"
 ME_England_Events.5.d: "With the consolidation of religious matters in the hands of the state, the nation has entered a hopefully temporary state of turmoil akin to chaos. With the dissolution of monasteries and other religious developments, our state finds itself met with pure iconoclastic rage, enough to inspire fear in the brave man's soul. The trumpets of rebellion sing their jaunty tune; the people of the north call for revolt. Their Pilgrimage is upon us."
 ME_England_Events.5.a: "Fools!"
 ME_England_Events.7.t: "Statutes of Iona"
 ME_England_Events.7.d: "With the establishment of state-funded schools in the Lowlands and our glorious conquest of the northern clans, we are now left with unruly clans that still resist our laws and try to govern themselves. The so-designated 'Statutes of Iona' are to end this cultural war and to bring the Highlander cultures closer to the much more English-like Lowlander Scottish."
 ME_England_Events.7.a: "Adopt the Statutes"
 ME_England_Events.7.b: "The clans should be left alone"
 ME_England_Events.9.t: "Work of William Caxton"
 ME_England_Events.9.d: "In our land of opportunity, another man succeeds. A Kentish man, William Caxton, aged 54, has established a printing press in Westminster. Year previously, he translated and printed the 'Recuyell of the Histories of Troye'. He even started working on a Encyclopaedia, which is soon due to finish."
 ME_England_Events.9.a: "Splendid!"
 ME_England_Events.10.t: "The Icy Grip of Death"
 ME_England_Events.10.d: "The once merry tune of church bells seems to fade unto the grey morning mist. At a time a source of joy, they call forth the open casket of our dear [Root.Monarch.GetName], pride and joy to all who served beneath him. As the bells slow, an eerie tune begins to sound throughout [Root.Capital.GetName]. Our former [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s body moves slowly through the city, without motion and without an heir to bequeath the throne. The [Root.GovernmentName] lay in ruin, and the succession remains untaken. There is but one person to seize our throne now. King of the Scots, [SCO.Monarch.GetName] was a distant to [Root.Monarch.GetName] and thus is the only seemingly legitimate heir to our lands."
 ME_England_Events.10.a: "Our relative in Scotland shall proceed to rule [Root.GetName]"
 ME_England_Events.10.b: "Let us appoint a local noble instead."
 ME_England_Events.11.t: "An Unresolved Conflict"
 ME_England_Events.11.d: "In spite of the countless wars and ceasefires, the conflict between the French and English Kingdoms stands unresolved. Throughout the years the [Root.Monarch.GetDynasty] claim to the French throne is growing weaker and weaker. It is time to strike the French Kingdom before our claim to their throne becomes nothing but a mere laughingstock for other european monarchs."
 ME_England_Events.11.a: "We will prevail!"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.1.t: "Trade Company Conflict"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.1.d: "Several prominent trade companies have engaged in a skirmish regarding the rights to a certain naval passage. Though the true possessor of these rights is clear, granting them to the opposing side is not an idea without merit."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.1.a: "Support the righteous one."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.1.b: "Accept the bribe from the other side."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.2.t: "New Company Created"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.2.d: "A new trade company has emerged, but not without opposition. The burgher coalition has no quarrels with its foundation, but detests any words of granting it a monopoly."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.2.a: "Give them Royal Charter."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.2.b: "They should not have a monopoly."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.3.t: "Mercantile Plans"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.3.d: "Several members of a prominent burgher family have approached us with plans for a new trade company. Should we accept, we grant a royal monopoly in return for a considerable portion of the proceedings."

 ME_Trade_Company_Events.3.b: "We cannot afford to spend the royal ducats."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.4.t: "Mercantile Plot"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.4.d: "A plot involving several important seats of Parliament taking bribes has come to light. The gilded corruptor in question happens to be a prominent trading company, soiling governance for their own gain."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.4.a: "With Sin comes punishment."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.4.b: "We shan't oppose their actions."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.5.t: "Company in Ruin"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.5.d: "A major trade company, through abhorrant spending practices, has gone bankrupt and is in the process of defaulting on their loans. Such proceedings would greatly damage regional trade."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.5.a: "Save them."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.5.b: "They have naught to blame but themselves."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.6.t: "Company Stock"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.6.d: "Rumor has it that a major company's stocks may be on the rise. Though we have no confirmation, if this is true, not investing would be a grave error."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.6.a: "We would rather invest and regret than the converse."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.6.b: "Such risks are beneath us."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.7.t: "Colonial Conflict"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.7.d: "A conflict has arisen regarding rights to a certain valuable plot of land. The clergy claim it as their own, and have already begun constructing a church at the location. However, we seem to have granted the same land to a nearby trade company for an outpost. The two factions cannot coincide; how shall we proceed?"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.7.a: "Allow construction of the outpost."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.7.b: "Cede the land to the church."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.8.t: "Trade Companies Demand Rights"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.8.d: "Several prominent trade companies of the nation have grown discontented despite their existing charters. They demand additional monopolies, and are prepared to back up their demands with steel."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.8.a: "Humour their petty demands."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.8.b: "Their complaining is of no consequence."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.9.t: "Rival Nation"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.9.d: "Our trade companies face steep resistance, and royal charters only go so far. In the face of foreign competition, our merchants have not been faring particularly well. Shall we step up to the challenge?"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.9.a: "Mercantilism first!"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.9.b: "We shan't anger the powers that be."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.10.t: "Stock Crash"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.10.d: "Perhaps hindsight is useless, but we really should have seen this coming. Ever since the establishment of the stock market, nobles and burghers alike have speculated heavily on upward trends, consequences be damned. The market is now in a downward spiral, with only future plummets in sight."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.10.a: "Save the market!"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.10.b: "Let it sort itself out."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.11.t: "Rise of the Trade Companies"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.11.d: "Not all done in the name of profits ends well. All investments involve risk, and in this case, the risk of economic collapse has become all too real. Several important trade companies have risen to power, going beyond their charter and exerting economic influence on the motherland. We may be too late to stop the chaos."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.11.a: "Worrisome."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.12.t: "Trade Companies Losing Influence"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.12.d: "Just as the economy has booms and recessions, so too do the trade companies that exert considerable influence upon it. Through some abhorrent spending practices, the trade companies have been forced to rescind their new influence and return to the confines of their charters."

 ME_Poland_Events.1.t: "Incorporation of Rawa and Belz to the Crown"
 ME_Poland_Events.1.d: "In 1462, as a result of the tragic death of the reigning Duke of Mazovia, the Polish Crown has incorporated the territories of Rawa and Belz into the Kingdom. Attempts were made to incorporate the state fully, but the keen politics and the opposition of the Mazovian Nobility has successfully prevented that from happening."
 ME_Poland_Events.1.a: "Splendid."
 ME_Poland_Events.1.b: "We cannot risk to displease the Mazovian Dukes!"
 ME_Poland_Events.2.t: "Founding of Zamosc"
 ME_Poland_Events.2.d: "Zamosc, Padua of the North, Pearl of the Renaissance, was a city founded by Jan Zamoyski, one of the most important political figures and magnates in the Commonwealth of his time. The city was built from scratch and was meant to be both functional, and as a splendid residence of the Zamoyski family. The city was built as per the ideals of Renaissance architecture, with some solutions introduced based on its unique location."
 ME_Poland_Events.2.a: "While he may be rich, he could use more funds for sure!"
 ME_Poland_Events.2.b: "Great news to hear!"
 ME_Poland_Events.3.t: "To Support a Holy War"
 ME_Poland_Events.3.d: "Our legate in Poland has been hard at work protecting the interests of the Christendom in the East. Among the topics that have been recently tackled would be a holy war against the tatars on the peripheries of catholicism. Should we send them funds?"
 ME_Poland_Events.3.a: "Support Them!"
 ME_Poland_Events.3.b: "Papacy cannot afford any expenditures"
 ME_Poland_Events.4.t: "Papal Support"
 ME_Poland_Events.4.d: "Papal State has pledged us funds, should we go to war with the vile heathen Tatars in the future. They also agreed to send more benefits when the war has begun."
 ME_Poland_Events.4.a: "Wonderful!"
 ME_Poland_Events.5.t: "Delivering on the Promise"
 ME_Poland_Events.5.d: "We have promised to pledge additional funds to Poland, should they actually follow up with a war against the Tatars. So they did, and now it is time we uphold our promise."
 ME_Poland_Events.5.a: "For Christendom!"
 ME_Poland_Events.6.t: "Moldavia Secured"
 ME_Poland_Events.6.d: "Our campaigning to the south has finally borne fruit. Through keen political manuevering, we were able to get hold of the Moldavian Principality. With the voivode's loyalty, our gates to the Black Sea lay open."
 ME_Poland_Events.6.a: "A stepping stone to Carogród for sure."
 ME_Poland_Events.6.b: "We are here merely for the profits."
 ME_Poland_Events.7.t: "Lisowczycy"
 ME_Poland_Events.7.d: "Lisowczycy was the name of a mercenary contingent mainly in employ across Eastern Europe, especially Poland. Also called Stracency which translates into 'Lost Men' or 'Forlorn Hope', were an extremely fierce company, which lead to them being effective in battle, but also very troublesome elsewhere."
 ME_Poland_Events.7.a: "Let us put them into employ!"
 ME_Poland_Events.7.b: "Troublemakers! Send them somewhere else..."
 ME_Poland_Events.8.t: "An Heir Needed in Bohemia"
 ME_Poland_Events.8.d: "Many of the nobles in Bohemia are willing to support the Jagiellonians on the Czech Throne. There are also many more which would also back this noble cause... for some other benefits of course."
 ME_Poland_Events.8.a: "Shower them in money."
 ME_Poland_Events.8.b: "Send our own men to help them out."
 ME_Poland_Events.8.c: "They can join us, if they want."
 ME_Poland_Events.9.t: "Transfer of Silesia"
 ME_Poland_Events.9.d: "Silesia has long-since splintered into many smaller counties, disunited and in vassalage to Bohemia or to the Polish Crown. Now with the seizure of the Bohemian Throne by the Polish Jagiellonians, it is time to bring an end to the disunity and to transfer those territories back into Polish fold."
 ME_Poland_Events.9.a: "An Excellent Proposal!"
 ME_Poland_Events.9.b: "This would make it messier than it already is."
 ME_Poland_Events.10.t: "The Senat"
 ME_Poland_Events.10.d: "Rada Królewska (Curia Regis, King's Court, Royal Council) was an insitution in Poland that was mainly an advisory body to the King. In the late 15th century it slowly began transforming itself into the Senat, the upper house of the Polish Parliament until the country's dissolution in 1795. The Senat was mainly controlled by the Polish Nobles, but other estates also had a say, such as the clerical Bishops."
 ME_Poland_Events.10.a: "Confirm current privileges"
 ME_Poland_Events.10.b: "Let us not let the estates get too influential"
 ME_Poland_Events.10.c: "Grant additional privileges"
 ME_Poland_Events.11.t: "Growth of National Industry"
 ME_Poland_Events.11.d: "Currently the majority of polish industry is comprised of artisans producing all kinds of textile-related products. Much of this is exported outwards, making our textiles well-known abroad. For those hearing about the polish splendor and power, curiosity guides them towards our borders. With those people come skilled workers, capable of bringing new industries to the towns."
 ME_Poland_Events.11.a: "Poland can prosper too!"
 ME_Poland_Events.11.b: "The old textile trade has never failed us."
 ME_Poland_Events.12.t: "A Puppet King"
 ME_Poland_Events.12.d: "The Jagiellonian kin in Hungary is weak and is being manipulated by the local nobles, wealthy or not. If we don't do anything about this, our hold over Hungary might grow weaker, and the noble rule in Hungary may continue to grow."
 ME_Poland_Events.12.a: "We won't allow him to be deceived!"
 ME_Poland_Events.12.b: "We need not meddle in their affairs, as long as they recognize our rule, of course."
 ME_Poland_Events.13.t: "A Chance of Remedy"
 ME_Poland_Events.13.d: "The tragic loss at Battle of Varna brought an end to the last crusade against the Ottomans. As horrible as the defeat may have been, the Polish Jagiellonians did not lose spirit, for they are back again trying to halt the Turkish Expansion into Europe. Question is, will we, the representatives of God on Earth, help them?"
 ME_Poland_Events.13.a: "We will help financially..."
 ME_Poland_Events.13.b: "The armies of [Root.GetName] will strike fear in the Janissaries!"
 ME_Poland_Events.13.c: "Hmm..."
 ME_Poland_Events.14.t: "Revenge for Varna"
 ME_Poland_Events.14.d: "The Varna Crusade has seen grave loss in the ranks of our Kings. King Vladislav, a fellow servant to the Holy Lord in Heaven, whose tragic death marked the end of the crusade, must be avenged. And is it not a joy that such vengeance is being done, as [Root.Monarch.GetName] has declared war on the Osmans, wishing to halt their expansion into Europe."
 ME_Poland_Events.14.a: "Request all help!"
 ME_Poland_Events.14.b: "We can do it all by ourselves."
 ME_Poland_Events.15.t: "Conversion to [Owner.Culture.GetName]"
 ME_Poland_Events.15.d: "Thanks to our keen policies of peaceful settlement and migrations, the [Owner.Culture.GetName] nobles and other estates are moving into the area of [Root.GetName]. This is causing the current population to slowly mix with the arriving immigrants and to slowly assimilate into our culture."
 ME_Poland_Events.15.a: "Excellent."
 ME_Poland_Events.16.t: "Work of Mikolaj Rej"
 ME_Poland_Events.16.d: "Born 1505 in Zurawno near Halicz, Mikolaj Rej is often called the Father of Polish Literature. A talented writer and translator, he managed to get favors of the King himself, who gifted him property for his servitude to the country. Even though Mikolaj knew the latin language, he was a promoter of creating in the Polish language, as opposed to many others of his time."
 ME_Poland_Events.16.a: "'The Polish are not geese, for they have their own language.'"
 ME_Poland_Events.17.t: "Jan Kochanowski"
 ME_Poland_Events.17.d: "Born 25 years after Mikolaj Rej, Jan Kochanowski is widely regarded as be the greatest poet of the first Rzeczpospolita. Of his work, the most famous has to be the cycle of Threnodies, dedicated to his daughter, Urszula, who died in infancy. Other notable work includes the play 'Dismissal of Greek Envoys', the 'Fraszki' cycle, 'Dawid's Psalter' and 'Piesni'."
 ME_Poland_Events.17.a: "An Excellent Creator!"
 ME_Poland_Events.18.t: "Growth of the Sicz"
 ME_Poland_Events.18.d: "With the policies of the Polish-Lithuanian Sejm, the Zaporozhian sich seems to only grow. More and more Ruthenian peasants, displeased by the catholic noblemen, flees to the wild fields and become a part of the Cossack brotherhood, bolstering their ranks. Perhaps it is time to give those rowdy group more autonomy to represent their truly unique relationship with our Monarchy."
 ME_Poland_Events.18.a: "Very Well, grant them autonomy!"
 ME_Poland_Events.18.b: "Cossack Register is enough."
 ME_Poland_Events.19.t: "Skarb Rawski"
 ME_Poland_Events.19.d: "Wojsko Kwarciane (quarter army) is the name given to the army units of the Commonwealth in the second half of the 16th century. Their origins stem from the Obrona Potoczna, who were permanent units tasked with defense of the state from foreign raids. The name of the army comes from the Quarter Tax, which was used to pay for their upkeep. The war chest for this purpose was stored in the castle in Rawa Mazowiecka."
 ME_Poland_Events.19.a: "Wonderful"
 ME_Poland_Events.20.t: "Order of the White Eagle"
 ME_Poland_Events.20.d: "Order Orla Bialego - Order of the White Eagle - was founded by his majesty, King August II the Strong, in November of 1705. Initially given to loyalists of the King, it would lose its prestige soonafter due to its value being debased by the ever-present selling of the title by the King's minister." #TODO: rewrite later
 ME_Poland_Events.20.a: "Those who show their bravery will be awarded."
 ME_Poland_Events.20.b: "Only those meritable shall receive it!"
 ME_Poland_Events.20.c: "I sense a business opportunity..."
 ME_Poland_Events.21.t: "Warsaw Confederation"
 ME_Poland_Events.21.d: "Following the Warsaw Confederation, an act granting Religious Freedoms, a peace of religious peace ensued. While many of the Western European states were embroiled in bloody religous conflicts, Poland stood tall as the bastion of tolerance. This has attracted many religious minorities, including the German Protestants, who settled in Prussia, both Royal and Ducal, and Polish Brethren, who were part of the Minor Reformed Church of Poland."
 ME_Poland_Events.21.a: "We welcome thee!"
 ME_Poland_Events.21.b: "A good development for sure."
 ME_Poland_Events.22.t: "[Root.GetName] Accepts the Pope!"
 ME_Poland_Events.22.d: "As per the Union of Brest, the ortodox church is welcome to accept Pope as their suzerain and continue practicing their own liturgy. Despite this noble offer of schism amendment, many orthodox christians still oppose the issue. Thankfully, the Lord has gifted those in [Root.GetName] true piety, for they stood out and embraced the Grecocatholic faith."
 ME_Poland_Events.22.a: "Wonderful!"
 ME_Poland_Events.23.t: "Fierce Resistance in [Root.GetName]"
 ME_Poland_Events.23.d: "Unfortunately, those in [Root.GetName] still oppose our pious union, stubborn to be on the wrong side of the schism... Hopefully the God will enlighten them of their misdeeds. For now, we will have to live with their attitude."
 ME_Poland_Events.23.a: "Continue our efforts." 
 ME_Poland_Events.23.b: "They'll learn to love us in no time!"
 ME_Poland_Events.24.t: "[Root.GetName] Resists Our Policies"
 ME_Poland_Events.24.d: "The orthodox population in [Root.GetName] is not all that happy with our methods. To  say that they dislike the idea of recognizing pope as their spiritual leader is to put it lightly. As a result, the orthodox peasantry began migration to their height of possibilities."
 ME_Poland_Events.24.a: "Typical naysayers... Good riddance!"
 ME_Poland_Events.24.b: "We can talk..."
 ME_Poland_Events.26.t: "Union of Brest"
 ME_Poland_Events.26.d: "The Ruthenian Uniate Church established as a result of the Union of Brest. Since its creation, it spurred controversy among the Ruthenian population, which viewed it as an act of Catholicization and Polonization. The main difference between the Orthodox and Uniate churches was the fact, that, while the latter recognized the Pope as their spiritual leader, the former did not."
 ME_Poland_Events.26.a: "A Brilliant Development!"
 ME_Poland_Events.27.t: "Migration of the Sicz"
 ME_Poland_Events.27.d: "The Zaporozhian Cossacks originally fled to the borderlands due to their desolation, but due to our expansionist policy, the borderlands are not quite on the border anymore, which has put the Sich in a weird situation."
 ME_Poland_Events.27.a: "Facilitate their Migration."
 ME_Poland_Events.27.b: "It's the end of the sicz!"
 ME_Poland_Events.28.t: "Tadeusz Kosciuszko"
 ME_Poland_Events.28.d: "Tadeusz Kosciuszko is one of the national heroes of not just Poland, but also United States and Belarus. Born in Mereczowszczyzna in 1746, he was ambitious and thanks to the support of Czarnecki family, he was able to study in the famed Corps of Cadets (Szkola Rycerska). He is known for his contribution to the American Independence War and his insurrection against the powers who were trying to have the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth fully annexed. Much could be said about the valour of this man."
 ME_Poland_Events.28.a: "This man will lead our armies!"
 ME_Poland_Events.28.b: "Under his management, our troops will know true drill."
 ME_Poland_Events.31.t: "Jagiellons in Kremlin"
 ME_Poland_Events.31.d: "In the early 17th century, during the Russian Time of Troubles, the Polish army was able to capture and occupy Moscow. During the war, candidacy of the Polish King's Son, Wladyslaw, was put forward. Popular among the pro-polish boyars, Poles were let back into the city, where boyars hoped Wladyslaw would convert to Orthodoxy and grant them privileges. This compromise did not appease King Sigismund however, who decided to seize the throne himself and to convert Russia to Roman Catholicism. That made him quite unpopular, and the polish garrison would soon be ousted thereafter."
 ME_Poland_Events.31.a: "Recruit from the russians."
 ME_Poland_Events.31.b: "Establish a garrison in Moscow."
 ME_Poland_Events.32.t: "Flota Kaperska and the Battle of Vistula Lagoon"
 ME_Poland_Events.32.d: "For the purposes of the Thirteen Years' War, the Polish-Lithuanian alliance has rented out a fleet of privateers to fight for them against the Teutonic Knights. That event proved to be quite beneficial, as the hired navy scored a victory against the Order in the Battle of Vistula Lagoon, weakening the enemy supply lines and depriving the garrison in Marienburg of morale."
 ME_Poland_Events.32.a: "We can expend a little bit."
 ME_Poland_Events.32.b: "We need funds for our land armies!"
 ME_Poland_Events.34.t: "War Ties Us Together"
 ME_Poland_Events.34.d: "The struggle of the Prussian Cities against the vile Teutonic Knights has united their and our causes together. We stand alone against this treasonous order!"
 ME_Poland_Events.34.a: "Welcome, Traders of Gdansk!"
 ME_Poland_Events.36.t: "Conversion to [Owner.Culture.GetName]"
 ME_Poland_Events.36.d: "Thanks to our keen policies of peaceful settlement and migrations, the [Owner.Culture.GetName] nobles and other estates are moving into the area of [Root.GetName]. This is causing the current population to slowly mix with the arriving immigrants and to slowly assimilate into our culture."
 ME_Poland_Events.36.a: "Sweet!"
 ME_Poland_Events.37.t: "Crown of Bohemia"
 ME_Poland_Events.37.d: "In 1003, the King Boleslaw the Brave has seized the opportunity and invaded the Kingdom of Bohemia, who was at the time in great unrest. Upon the conquest, he declared himself the King of Bohemia. Unfortunately, due to his policy of looting, he was deeply disliked among the Czech Nobility, who incited a rebellion in Prague and deposed Boleslaw year after. This time will be different. This time [Root.Monarch.GetName] will be crowned, and he will be crowned with support and everlasting loyalty of the Bohemian nobles!"

 # Missions:
 RHN_franconia_title: "A Mere Obstacle"
 RHN_franconia_desc: "While we proclaim that we are the nation of Rhineland, we were perhaps too hasty in our judgement. For instance, we have not yet seized control of the various neighboring territories that jointly inhabit the Rhine, posing a significant threat to our safety. Logically speaking, they should be our next target."
 RHN_swabia_title: "Follow the Rhine South"
 RHN_swabia_desc: "Swabia is both developed and ripe for the picking. Though the area is under the protection of the Holy Roman Emperor, we should be able to take it anyway, peacefully or by force."
 RHN_bavaria_title: "But a Thorn in our Side"
 RHN_bavaria_desc: "The Baravian region presents both a threat and an opportunity. Their strength and power is a threat, but if incoroporated into our great nation, it could prove a decent manpower--and beer--source for exploitation. Thus to satisfy both the doctrines of defense and attack, we must invade."
 RHN_westphalia_title: "Secure Westfalen"
 RHN_westphalia_desc: "Though we may already control some of Westphalia, it is best not to leave a people divided between two nations. As a mercy to their ethnicity, we must invade the rest of Westphalia and assert our control to reunite the self-imposed schism."
 RHN_saxony_title: "King of the Germans"
 RHN_saxony_desc: "Saxony has long since been a thorn in our side, blocking expansion to the east. No more. The Saxons shall know their place under the glory of Rhineland."
 RHN_lower_saxony_title: "In Pursuit of Silver"
 RHN_lower_saxony_desc: "The Rhenish Nation and its immediate neighborhood demands for luxurious goods. Rhineland, being the industrial center of Western Europe, shall provide for the demand, and to achieve that, the Silver produced in Lower Saxony and [57.GetName] must be seized."
 RHN_manufactories_title: "Adopt the Manufakturen"
 RHN_manufactories_desc: "Entrepeneurs in other states are already setting up workplaces of mass production. Why shouldn't we get in on the 'Manufactories'? Let us go to great lengths to invest into this new technology, for the only way to stay ahead of our neighbors is proper investment."
 RHN_workshops_title: "The Prelude to Brilliance"
 RHN_workshops_desc: "The Rhenish nation dreams, and it dreams big. But before the ambitions of the nation can be achieved, we must start simple. It is of utmost importance that we construct additional infrastructure, as the current one doesn't seem enough to get our nation on its feet. Soonafter, we may begin greater projects."
 RHN_the_guard_on_rhine_title: "Die Wacht am Rhein"
 RHN_the_guard_on_rhine_desc: "The proximity of the French forces is worrying at best. The tensions have been high for quite some time, and it is not all that unlikely that the French will finally vie for the control of Western Germany, as they've done numerous time. We must put our watchmen on the Rhine so as to prevent the French from ever achieving their audicious natural borders."
 RHN_press_title: "Benefits of the Print"
 RHN_press_desc: "Recently, for in the 1440s, Johannes Gutenberg, a brilliant Rhenish mind, became the father of the European Printing Press, forever-changing the intellectual landscape of the old continent. Thanks to his invention, we can now reap the benefits of this ground-shaking invention."
 RHN_fine_german_print_title: "Fine German Print"
 RHN_fine_german_print_desc: "The Printing Press was invented in Rhineland, so it is only natural that we become the center and the staple of the fine german print. We shall invoke a chauvinist attitude towards our book wares, making them a symbol of quality and dissemination of knowledge."
 RHN_press_and_the_faith_title: "The Faith and the Press"
 RHN_press_and_the_faith_desc: "With firm grip on the Press within our state, we can push our agendas as we will, and in this ever-more conflict-ridden times, unity is something that we need. Aforementioned unity can be achieved with an intervention in our press, thanks to which we could promote religious tolerance, or to grow the religious unity within our country by religious press."
 RHN_copper_foundries_title: "Appropriation of Kopfer"
 RHN_copper_foundries_desc: "Rhineland has been with vast amounts of resources. Among those is Copper, an important component of metals such as Brass and Bronze. Being localized in the vicinity of [83.GetName], it is in prime position for exploitation. We shall make an excellent use of it in our goal of industrialization!"
 RHN_optics_title: "Kasseler Optics"
 RHN_optics_desc: "The backbone of Rhenish industry isn't just one, few, or many, but all resources. This includes glass, which has seen many new uses for it being discovered recently. One of those is the production of optics, with which we hope to open up new trade links to major naval powers."
 RHN_moselle_title: "Moselle Thrives"
 RHN_moselle_desc: "While not all of Rhineland is covered with valuable resource deposits, it doesn't meant that the regions left out must remain abandoned. The Moselle Valley is one of those areas, and we shan't let it decay. Under our guidance, not only will the lands surrounding Moselle not deteriotate, but they will thrive and prosper."
 RHN_zinc_title: "Zinc Deposits of Rhineland"
 RHN_zinc_desc: "Having put our Copper into more uses, it is time we grow the scale, at which resources are extracted from the ground. One of those resources that we will certainly need more of is Zinc, the basis for the production of the Brass alloy. Currently it is excavated in [4768.GetName], but there is also more than enough evidence that a large-scale extraction could be established in [81.GetName]."
 RHN_german_tin_title: "Monopolize German Tin"
 RHN_german_tin_desc: "While the facilities for Tin are of plenty in Germany, the largest and most significant ones are probably in [1757.GetName]. The area must be seized from the current holder, and we must erect appropriate infrastructure so as to monopolize this necessary resource."
 RHN_jewellery_title: "Producing Jewellery"
 RHN_jewellery_desc: "While profits can be made by selling anything, one of the most profitable industries that we know of is definitely producing all kinds of Jewellery. Greatly desired by all noble families of Europe; "
 RHN_iron_title: "Grow the Steel Industry"
 RHN_iron_desc: "Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon that results in the creation of a much-more durable material than its components. Currently though, its usage is far from widespread and the field hasn't seen any innovations in recent history. It's high time this material gets the attention it deserves."
 RHN_ruhrgebiet_title: "Ruhrgebiet"
 RHN_ruhrgebiet_desc: "The valley of Ruhr is in hightly strategic position, as it is in the prime spot to be a center of ore processing and advanced metallurgy. The area has already began thriving since our successful efforts in growing the steel industry, and we must let the area become the most prospering aglomeration Central Europe has to offer."
 RHN_military_industry_title: "Military Industry"
 RHN_military_industry_desc: "The main purposes of growing national industries is to acquire a budget that would fuel further improvements. Not all developments have to serve that purpose though. Military concerns are just as important, if not more so. The value of our provinces grows, attracting many wolves, and we must be strong enough to fight back such wolfpack."
 RHN_coal_title: "A Precursor to a Revolution"
 RHN_coal_desc: "Coal is certainly an underappreciated resource. Mined for several purposes, its extraction isn't vast and definitely doesn't form an important sector in the mining business. However, it seems like there's much more to coal than it is currently thought. Perhaps it is the time to give it a try?"
 RHN_blast_furnaces_title: "Technology of Hochofen"
 RHN_blast_furnaces_desc: "Blast Furnaces are metallurgical devices used to smelt all kinds of resources. Unfortunately though, they are currently severely underused. We shall reveal the true advantages this technology has to offer."
 RHN_fill_the_land_title: "Shake the Ground"
 RHN_fill_the_land_desc: "Let us fill our provinces with Blast Furnaces. Let us project the power of our innovative technologies. All nations in Europe shall marvel at the Rhenish Lands, emitting the light of the Industrial Revolution that will forever change the course of history."
 RHN_center_of_europe_title: "The Center of Europe"
 RHN_center_of_europe_desc: "Rhineland, near the center, a bit to the side, truly the heart of Europe, both geographically, culturally and industrially. After all of our efforts, is there really someone who hasn't heard of the famed Rhenish Quality? Is there a despot, a ruler, a noble who doesn't own Rhenish Books, Rhenish Jewellery? The prevalent Rhenish Optic lead navies to victory, while the Rhenish military complex dominates."
 RHN_leather_title: "Agricultural Revolution"
 RHN_leather_desc: "No industry shall be left behind. One sector left largely unaffected is the agriculture, which hasn't seen no developments under our management. It's high time we changed that!"
 RHN_religion_title: "Religion des Rheinlands"

 ME_Rhenish_Events.1.d: "A revolutionary evolution in modern arts has swept across Europe. Though originating in Italy, it has spread like a tidal wave across Germany, taking root in even [Root.GetName]. We would do well to foster such an advent, though to what end we are unsure."
 ME_Rhenish_Events.1.a: "Hire a local Humanist."
 ME_Rhenish_Events.1.b: "Patronize the Arts."
 ME_Rhenish_Events.1.c: "Fund a Renaissance Building."
 ME_Rhenish_Events.2.t: "Benefits of the Press"
 ME_Rhenish_Events.2.d: "With the invention of Printing Press by Johannes Gutenberg in the middle of first century brought a true revolution to the daily life of Europeans. With Printing Press being embraced by cities throught Europe, books became accessible to the middle class allowing spread of new ideas to lower social layers. Now, with Printing Press embraced by our state, we are able to use this revolutionary technique to our advantage. We can exploit this in several ways; filling the press with Propaganda, institute an extra tax or try to promote literacy."
 ME_Rhenish_Events.2.a: "Make it affordable for the peasantry too!"
 ME_Rhenish_Events.2.b: "Promote Interests of our State"
 ME_Rhenish_Events.2.c: "Institute an Extra Tax"
 ME_Rhenish_Events.3.t: "The Matters of Faith in the Press"
 ME_Rhenish_Events.3.d: "The Printing Press has enabled the crown to proliferate information at an astounding rate, never before seen to Europe. Both its efficiency and efficacy know no bounds. To this end, we should utilize such a machination to promote our religious policy. Through tolerance or strife, the printing press shall prove invaluable to our adminstration."
 ME_Rhenish_Events.3.a: "We should promote our faith in the times of need."
 ME_Rhenish_Events.3.b: "We shall strive for tolerance!"
 ME_Rhenish_Events.4.t: "A Trading Partner"
 ME_Rhenish_Events.4.d: "Optics are used for many purposes. They are used as a mean to correct eyesight problems, a tool for reconaissance, and they are, most importantly, a vital part of the naval combat. Unfortunately, [RHN.GetName] being an inland nation, it can't use the spectacles to their fullest potential. Therefore, it would be an excellent idea to find a powerful naval power willing to purchase these."
 ME_Rhenish_Events.4.a: "Send [Rhineland_target_1.GetName] an offer."
 ME_Rhenish_Events.4.b: "We are sure to come to an agreement with [Rhineland_target_2.GetName]."
 ME_Rhenish_Events.4.c: "[Rhineland_target_3.GetName] will surely pay for the highest quality."
 ME_Rhenish_Events.5.t: "A Most Generous Offer"
 ME_Rhenish_Events.5.d: "We have been offered, by the mighty nation of Rhineland, a rather significant and continuous shipment of naval glasswork and optic equipment, extremely useful for maritime ventures. We lack the proper facilities to procure this equipment at a similar rate to those of Rhenish origin, thus we cannot rule out the possible gains from trade."
 ME_Rhenish_Events.5.a: "Accept the offer!"
 ME_Rhenish_Events.5.b: "We can produce anything we need ourselves."
 ME_Rhenish_Events.6.t: "Zinc in Oberhessen"
 ME_Rhenish_Events.6.d: "Despite excavating zinc in the province of [4768.GetName], a rising Industrial Power of [RHN.GetName] is bound to require more Zinc than a single mine can produce. We do know that Oberhessen has large zinc deposits that could be exploited. However, large-scale exploitation would hurt the current industry in Oberhessen."
 ME_Rhenish_Events.6.a: "Embrace the Zinc!"
 ME_Rhenish_Events.6.b: "The current industry is just too precious."
 ME_Rhenish_Events.7.t: "Leather Processing"
 ME_Rhenish_Events.7.d: "Since the dawn of humanity, Livestock was farmed so as to produce meat and leather, which would later go on to be eaten or sold. Now, with the advent of Advanced Leather Processing in [leather_province.GetName], the technology has begun to spread, and consequently, the demand for the Livestock produce has increased significantly. Now, the livestock is farmed en masse, so as to meet the demand of this rising industry."
 ME_Rhenish_Events.7.a: "Wonderful!"
 ME_Rhenish_Events.8.t: "The Coal Industry"
 ME_Rhenish_Events.8.d: "As it currently stands, Coal exploitation is far from being the central part of our economy. However, there are rumours of there being much more to the resource than we initially thought. It might be profitable to begin a large-scale exploitation of the resource, albeit gradually."
 ME_Rhenish_Events.8.a: "By all means, let us proceed!"
 ME_Rhenish_Events.8.b: "Coal? It's a recipe for a disaster."
 ME_Rhenish_Events.9.t: "Advanced Faceting"
 ME_Rhenish_Events.9.d: "Following the discovery of advanced faceting techniques that happened in the dawn of Renaissance, many have begun trying to best these ways. Those attempts have resulted in little to no advances in the field until this day. Recently, a Rhenish gem-cutter discovered a new method in diamond-cutting which caused the Jewellery produced in [diamond_province.GetName] to excel not just in quality, but also beauty. [diamond_province.GetName], in addition to the current [old_diamond_province.GetName], will be a new seat of the global jewel-making."
 ME_Rhenish_Events.9.a: "Old pave the way for the new."
 ME_Rhenish_Events.9.b: "Gems are truly outrageous."
 ME_Rhenish_Events.10.t: "The Crisis in [BRG.GetName]"
 ME_Rhenish_Events.10.d: "The ruler of [BRG.GetName] has died unexpectedly. As per the inheritance treaty signed with the local dynasty, [Root.Monarch.GetName] is to succeed in [BRG.GetName]."
 ME_Rhenish_Events.10.a: "This is more than ideal!"
 ME_Rhenish_Events.11.t: "New Industry in Moselle Valley"
 ME_Rhenish_Events.11.d: "With increased industral capacity giving way to further exports, we find our manufactories overworked in the Moselle Valley. Though we could alleviate the problem, we have received suggestions regarding the state-sponsored production in the region. Should we lay back agricultural subsidies and instead allow our loggers to go to work, we might yet find ourselves a profitable new source of timber for our future projects."

 ME_Russia_Events.5.t: "Reforming our Diplomats"
 ME_Russia_Events.5.d: "It is not uncommon to visit Moscow and see the people there start hating on your 'Tyrannic Western' look, and how they wish they helped Mother Russia when time was needed. Our Tsar has realized that this and is willing to become more open to towards them."

 ME_Russia_Events.6.b: "...Be allowed to retain their independence."
 ME_Russia_Events.7.t: "Problem in the Steppes"

 ME_Russia_Events.7.b: "The more enslaved, the more obedient."

The new rulers introduced the cultivation of cedar and cotton, built an irrigation system and, in particular, the Arabic language, which most of the population adopted as their mother tongue. Its influence in modern Maltese is easily found, as well as the presence of words of Latin origin and of the Latin alphabet. The Arab domination lasted for about two centuries, from 870 to 1091, during which Islam became the main religion on the island (although Christians were allowed to practice their worship). \nThe period of Arab domination ended in 1091 when the island was conquered by the Normans from the Kingdom of Sicily, at the helm of Ruggero d'Altavilla. The archipelago thus entered the Sicilian orbit, and was placed under the control of the members of the Norman house of Sicily, although in fact it was a little more than nominal control. In 1191 Margarito of Brindisi landed again on the island and was appointed first count of Malta.

However, throughout the fifteenth century, despite some obsolete interpretations, the architecture continued to follow the late Gothic tradition despite the presence of Renaissance decorative episodes. \nThe renewal of language therefore did not immediately involve the entire building organization. The main Sicilian architect of the fifteenth century was in fact Matteo Carnilivari who used a personal language with Gothic and Catalan elements, as in the church of Santa Maria della Catena in Palermo. His prestige as a builder was one of the obstacles to the affirmation of the Renaissance language, outside the decorative repertoire of marble workers.

The climatic conditions of the Two Sicilies favored the production of wheat, barley, oats, potatoes, legumes and oil. Also important were the cultivation of citrus fruits and many other plants suitable for the Mediterranean climate, such as the olive tree, the vine, the fig, the cherry, the chestnut, the hazelnut, the walnut and the almond tree. Areas very exploited for the cultivation of fruit trees were for example the countryside around Vesuvius. The breeding was mainly sheep (wool), horses and pigs."

He easily submits to discipline, when this moves from a just power, strong and constant. The elementary education of the different weapons is excellent: they maneuver exactly and promptly, both separate and united; The Neapolitan and Sicilian military institutions boast a much older history, which has its foundations in the organization of a "state-owned" (ie state and no longer feudal) army by Ferrante d Aragon in 1464. In particular, the Spanish viceregal period (1503-1714) profoundly marked the military customs of the subsequent Bourbon period. During this time the soldiers of southern Italy were in fact involved in almost all the military events of the Spanish Empire (from the wars of Charles V to the wars of Flanders, from the colonial campaigns in America to the thirty years war), often giving proof of great value and loyalty to the imperial authorities. The captains, belonging to the best feudal nobility of the Neapolitan and Sicilian provinces, were able to frame and prepare the subjects of the two viceroys for war, obeying the firm political direction given by the monarchs of Spain."

Place of origin of the Latin language, it was the capital of the Roman Empire which extended its dominion over the whole Mediterranean basin and most of Europe, the Papal States, subjected to the temporal power of the popes and the future Kingdom of Italy.

 tts_protecting_sea_zones_desc: "The merchant navy was made up almost entirely of small woods, good for cabotage and fishing, and more than 40,000 sailors mounted it, a number inadequate for the tonnage of the ships. Navigation was limited to the coasts of the Adriatic and the Mediterranean, and the slow progress of the maritime forces did not consist in decreasing the number of logs and increasing their range, but in multiplying the small ships. The steam merchant navy was very scarce, despite the fact that one of the first steamships, which plowed the waters of the Mediterranean, was built in Naples in 1818. It apparently seemed the largest in Italy, while in reality the Sardinian was inferior, and also as a warship, it was scarce for a Kingdom, of which the third part was formed by Sicily and the other two thirds formed a large pier launched towards the Levant. The navy and the army were at the antipodes: the army was disproportionate to the country for exuberance, the navy for deficiency."

 tts_royal_palace_title: "Reggia di Caserta"
 tts_royal_palace_desc: "The location is of exceptional beauty, in the most luxuriant plain in the world, but with extensive gardens that extend to the hills; an aqueduct leads you to an entire river, which waters the palace and its surroundings, and this water mass it can transform, pouring it on artificial rocks, into a wonderful waterfall. The gardens are beautiful and harmonize very much with this district which is a single garden. \nThe Royal Palace of Caserta was wanted by the King of Sicily [Root.Monarch.GetName], who, taken from a competition with the French royals and eager to donate structures to Naples that could play the role of the capital city of European level, he decided to inaugurate a palace that could rival in magnificence and grandeur with those of the European capitals. For safety reasons, the chosen location was Casertavecchia about 15 km north of the capital. \nThe king asked that the project include, in addition to the palace, the park and the arrangement of the surrounding urban area, with the supply from a new aqueduct (Acquedotto Carolino) that would cross the annexed complex of San Leucio. The new palace was to be a symbol of the new Bourbon state and to show power and grandeur, but also to be efficient and rational. \nThe project was part of the broader political plan of king [Root.Monarch.GetName], who probably also wanted to move some administrative structures of the state to the new Royal Palace, connecting it to the capital Naples with a monumental avenue of over 15 km."
 tts_maschio_angioino_title: "Maschio Angioino"
 tts_maschio_angioino_desc: "The presence of an external monarchy had set the urban planning of Naples around the center of royal power, constituting an alternative urban center, formed by the port and the two main adjacent castles, Castel Capuano and Castel dell'Ovo. This relationship between the royal court and town planning had already manifested itself with Frederick II, who in the 13th century, in the Swabian statute, had concentrated the greatest attention on castles, neglecting the city walls at all. To the two existing castles the Angevins added the main one, Castel Nuovo (Chastiau neuf), which was not only a fortification but above all their grandiose palace. \nThe royal residence of Naples had until then been Castel Capuano, but the ancient Norman fortress was judged inadequate for its function and the king wanted to build a new castle near the sea. \nAssigned the project to the French architect Pierre de Chaulnes, the works for the construction of the Castrum Novum began in 1279 and ended just three years later, a very short time given the construction techniques of the time and the overall size of the work. However, the king never resided there: following the revolt of the Sicilian Vespers, which cost Angioino the crown of Sicily, conquered by Peter III of Aragon and other events, the new palace remained unused until 1285, the year of his death. by Carlo I. \nAlfonso of Aragon, who had conquered the throne of Naples in 1443, wanted to establish in the castle the function of the center of royal power and a court of magnificence that could compete with that of Lorenzo the Magnificent in Florence. The fortress was completely rebuilt in its present form. King Alfonso entrusted the renovation of the old Angevin palace-fortress to an Aragonese architect, Guillem Sagrera, a Catalan from Mallorca, who conceived it in Gothic-Catalan terms. \nThe five round towers, four of which incorporated the previous Angevin towers with a square plan, more suitable for withstanding the shots of the guns of the time, reaffirmed the defensive role of the castle. The importance of the building as a center of royal power was instead underlined by the insertion of the triumphal arch at its entrance, a masterpiece of the Neapolitan Renaissance and the work of Francesco Laurana as well as many artists of various origins."
 tts_union_of_crowns_title: "Union of the Crowns"
 tts_union_of_crowns_desc: "The Kingdom of Sicily, born in 1130, began to be referred to as the Kingdom of Sicily beyond the lighthouse (or further) and the Kingdom of Sicily on this side of the lighthouse (or higher), in reference to the lighthouse of Messina and therefore to the close homonym, in 1268 when Charles I of Anjou crowned by Pope Clement IV rex Siciliae, transferred the capital to Naples and the Sicilian nobility claimed this title for themselves, supporting the requests of Peter III of Aragon and thus starting the war of the Vespers . The peace of Caltabellotta, in 1302, sanctioned the end of the war and gave the aforementioned separation (according to the agreements, on the death of the Aragonese king Frederick of Aragon, the island should have returned to the Angevins, which in reality did not happen)."
 tts_pizza_title: "'A Pizza"
 tts_pizza_desc: "The most ordinary pizzas called coll'aglio e l'oglio, have oil for seasoning, and over it is spread salt, oregano and minced garlic cloves. Others are covered with grated cheese and seasoned with lard, and then a few basil leaves are placed on top. To the first, small fish is often added; to the second thin slices of muzzarella. Sometimes use is made of sliced ham, tomatoes, clams, etc. Sometimes folding the pasta on itself forms what is called calzone. \nThis culinary beauty has been spread all over the world for its practical use and divine goodness."
 tts_king_jerusalem_title: "King of Jerusalem"
 tts_king_jerusalem_desc: "The kingdom of Jerusalem originated following the first crusade, when the Christian army led by Godfrey of Bouillon conquered the Holy City (July 15, 1099). Godfrey, after renouncing the royal title, obtained that of Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri (Protector of the Holy Sepulcher) and was crowned Governor of Jerusalem in the Basilica of the Nativity in Bethlehem. \nAt his death the following year, his brother Baldwin was the first of the rulers to be crowned with the title of king of Jerusalem. The ceremony took place in the Basilica of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem. The exact formula of the royal title was Rex Latinorum Hierosolymitanus, ie \"King of the Latins of Jerusalem\", meaning that the sovereign's jurisdiction did not include the native populations: Christian, Muslim and Jewish. \nThe succession to the throne of Jerusalem generally took place according to both hereditary and elective criteria. Even when the title was inherited within the same ruling family, the sovereign always received validation from the Jerusalem High Court. The king was in fact considered a primus inter pares (first among equals) rather than a real monarch, so much so that in his absence the functions of government were entrusted to his officers."
 tts_duomo_monreale_title: "Duomo di Monreale"
 tts_duomo_monreale_desc: "According to legend, William II the Good, who succeeded his father on the throne of Sicily, would have fallen asleep under a carob tree, overwhelmed by fatigue, while hunting in the woods of Monreale. In a dream the Madonna appeared to him, to whom he was very devoted, who revealed the secret of a \"truvatura\" with these words: \"In the place where you are sleeping the greatest treasure in the world is hidden: unearth it and build a temple in my honor ". Having said these words, the Virgin disappeared and William, confident of the revelation in a dream, ordered that the carob be uprooted and dug around it. With great amazement, a treasure in gold coins was discovered which were immediately destined for the construction of the Cathedral of Monreale, to which Greek-Byzantine mosaic masters (“the masters of the oru”) of the interior were called for the realization."
 tts_parramentu_sicilianu_title: "Parlamento del Regno di Sicilia"
 tts_parramentu_sicilianu_desc: "The Sicilian parliament was made up of three "branches" ("feudal", "ecclesiastical" and "state property"). The feudal branch was made up of the noble representatives of counties and baronies, the ecclesiastical branch was made up of archbishops, bishops, abbots and archimandrites, while the state branch was made up of representatives of the 42 state-owned cities of Sicily. The first Norman parliament was not deliberative, and had only a consultative and ratification function of the sovereign's activity, especially in taxation, in the economy and in the management of relations with foreign powers. The deputies were chosen from among the most powerful nobles. The first radical change took place with Frederick II of Swabia, who also allowed partial access to civil society, such as state-owned cities. Federico gathered a parliament in September 1221 in Messina known as the "Assise di Messina", where he proceeded to reorganize the legislation of the Regnum by promulgating a further nucleus of assisae, four or five, conceived to defend morality, order and "good customs "of the Kingdom", the first nucleus of those that in 1231 would have been promulgated in Melfi as Constitutionum Regni Siciliarum, then integrated into the Syracuse assembly in 1233."
 tts_university_federico_II_title: "Università Federico II"
 tts_university_federico_II_desc: "The erection of the Studium was decreed by Emperor Frederick II of Swabia on 5 June (5 July according to some sources) 1224 through a circular letter (generalis lictera) sent from Syracuse. Since it was created at the behest of the emperor, the University of Naples is considered by far the first lay university in Europe of a state type (not founded, that is, by corporations or associations of intellectuals, or students, but by virtue of a provision sovereign). \nInitially the studies were directed towards law (fundamental for the training of jurists), the liberal arts, medicine and theology: the latter, compared to other subjects, was taught in religious centers, in particular in the convent of San Domenico Maggiore , where Thomas Aquinas taught from 1271 to 1274. During the Angevin period (1265-1443) the structure and organization of the University remained substantially unchanged. \nFurthermore, during the Angevin period the University of Naples, unlike the others, remained independent from papal power: in fact, Charles I of Anjou reaffirmed and increased the previous privileges granted by the Swabian kings to the University. The first difficulties came with the advent of the Aragonese dominion in 1443, which in fact forced the university to a first closure."

Scorched earth, ravaged by war, subsides into the annals of history, stepping back to the shadows, for one day a new empire shall rise and take its place, repeating the merciless cycle Timur himself once took part in. Betrayed by ambitious relatives, manipulated by greedy nobles, and led astray by his own ignorance, $MONARCH$'s decrepit empire meets its match at last. The future remains uncertain for Persia."

 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTDESC2: "As the days grew innumerable, the parched and hunger-stricken forces of Herat began to lose their last flicker of hope. Famine plagued men in likeness to disease, both ravaging each street they galloped throughout the city. The stricken people of the Pearl of Khorasan were under unbearable stress as the weight of heaven itself began pushing down on their shoulders, just as hell rose up to greet their sodden corpses. Surrender was imminent, and the gates of Herat opened to be greeted by an equally tumultuous fate. What once was considered Shah Rukh's golden jewel in the deserts of Persia is now reduced to the ashes and cinder of lost hope, shattered dreams, and a dead city."

 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTDESC3: "Atop the rich throne of Transoxiana sits grandson of Tamerlane, Ulugh Beg himself. Among the princes of the Timurid Empire, Beg was in perhaps the best position in 1444. He exerted considerable influence over the Silk Road, controlling one of its main stops: Samarkand. The only true danger to Transoxiana was the Uzbek Horde, which launched dozens of border raids of the years. The Chagatai sit to the east, weakened and ripe for the taking. To our west, the Khorasani wait patiently for the death of Shah Rukh, though hardly in a state to begin their conquests. Ulugh Beg is the only prince in a truly favorable position, which he will undoubtedly use to his advantage."

 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTDESC4: "Babur bin Baysunkur, also known as Abul-Qasim Babur Mirza, was perhaps the greatest strategist of the Timurid brothers. Though his holdings were relatively small, he would move on to defeat the Transoxianians in combat, nearly restoring the Timurid Empire to its height under Shah Rukh. Khorasan sits in a somehwat troubling position: a handful of Persian nations to the west offer promising expansion, but if we cannot deal with Ulugh Beg, he will surely spell our downfall."

 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTNAME6: "Heir of the Shah?"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTDESC6: "Ulugh Beg, born of Shah Rukh, remains the last truly legitimate successor to the Timurid Empire. Alongside the collapse of Rukh's empire was a power vacuum, which we succesfully filled with our own image of greatness. The time has come to proclaim ourselves the next Timurid Empire and continue the task of Tamerlane."

A great scholar, he helped push the scientific fields further, while also ruling his domain. For his great deeds, he was consequently nicknamed 'Ulugh Beg' which means 'Great Ruler'."

With the death of Shah Rukh, the beloved father of Ulugh Beg, the empire is in shambles. It's high time we bring an end to its suffering and acquire our inheritance."

 transoxiana_deal_with_khorasan_desc: "Babur bin Baysunkur of the Timurid Dynasty is one of the most rowdy and powerful contestants to the Timurid Throne.

There is only one heir of Shah Rukh and that is Ulugh Beg!"

By rebelling, he brought shame upon his branch of the family and his posessions should now be reintegrated into the proper Timurid Empire."

 transoxiana_usurp_the_throne_desc: "With beloved Shah Rukh dead and his illegitimate heir removed from the Timurid Throne, it's time for Ulugh Beg to usurp his rightful position as the new Timurid Emperor. Originally given to Ulugh Beg, the title of heir to the Timurid Empire was unjustly snapped up by Ala al-Dawla Abd Allah Timurid. Fortunately, his rule is now over and the Timurid Scepter may soon lie in the hands of Ulugh Beg."

These vile nomads must be dealt with. "

 transoxiana_reclaim_sistan_desc: "Sistan has always been part of Timur's Empire. However, since the fall of Herat and the imminent collapse of the Timurid Administration, the Mihrabanids have been free from the shackles. It is time to restore the Timurid rule over Sistan."

 WES_forcelimit_desc: "The pride of Westphalia lies in the guard of the King: The army. It's our ultimate wall - Our line of defence - against the external enemies that are our fellow Germans. And yet, despite how glorious the Guard is, it is lacking. It is not perfect enough for a nation like Westphalia. It is lacking in the field of technology, size, and military strategies. We ought to fix that."

It means our nation is not an old one much like the Romans, Ottomans or French that are slowly stagnating or even collapsed.

If we are to make Westphalia into a meaningful footnote in History we need to expand our state and fulfill our very own destiny."
 WES_westphalia_title: "Dux Orientalis Saxonum"
 WES_westphalia_desc: "If there is any realm of yore we have ancestry towards then it would be Saxony. Large swathes of land that we control belong  to the Old Saxony.

Let us lay waste upon our enemies and carve up Old Saxony of the North as part of Westphalia proper."
 WES_rhineland_title: "Herzog von Westfalen"

 WES_army_title: "Grow our Forces"
 WES_army_desc: "As times change so do need for different weaponry and tactics. Traditions, though helpful at preserving useful battle tactics, often become outdated when new weapons get invented and introduced to the army.

 WES_city_fortifications_title: "City Fortifications"
 WES_city_fortifications_desc: "Our cities are filled to the fullest with beautiful architecture. Not only that but they are also the beating heart of our economy. In times of war our cities are at risk of being sieged down and sacked by enemy forces, tarnishing and scarring our nation. We need to slow down and lessen the amount of damage our enemies can cause upon us in war. To do this we need to fortify every city of importance that exists in Westphalia. No Urban Westphalian shall ever again experience the dread of open plains from where the enemy can come unstopped. The urban Westphalians shall be surrounded by the symbol of protection - wall."
 WES_renaissance_title: "Weserrenaissance"
 WES_renaissance_desc: "Like a disease Renaissance has spread from Italy all across Europe. Unlike a disease it has some uses besides in warfare, as it can be used to promote intellectual exchange and interactions, thus helping with innovation and progress of our state.

 WES_reformation_desc: "Nails were placed against a piece of paper and a church's door, and from it came a wildfire named Reformation. It spread far and wide and brought with it pain and destruction upon the citizens of Holy Roman Empire. Pope's authority has been questioned, and with it comes a potential - a choice. Westphalia's stance on Reformation is a bit uncertain: It can be seen as beneficial for us to help Pope re-assert spiritual reign over the Germans or we may embrace the Reformation and liberate ourselves slowly piece-by-piece from the foreign Italians. Our path remains uncertain and is up to our Monarch to decide."
 WES_expand_city_title: "Expand the City"
 WES_expand_city_desc: "Westphalia needs a city to serve as a capital, and this capital ought to be large, wealthy and prestigious.

We need to change the sin and darkness that shrouds the Northern Germany and turn us into a location reminiscient of the virtuous Southern Germany. Temples shall be built, church attendance shall be reinforced, and our clergy shall receive their fairshare of donations. All in name of ensuring our faith is strong in our subjects."
 WES_estates_title: "Quell the Estates"
 WES_estates_desc: "The estates are parasites given false appearance of civility. On surface they may appear noble and just, but once you go below the skin their decadence and corruption become apparent. We should treat our estates as what they are - vermin requiring some pesticide to quell down their tainted clutch in the affairs of the state."
 WES_assert_control_title: "Assert Control"
 WES_assert_control_desc: "The Monarch serves no one but God. His right to rule is gained from God up above. He should not serve any lowly estates that are beneath him, nor a foreign ruler ruling from a den of sin. The absolute authority in Westphalia is the King and we need to ensure this remains as the ultimate fact."
