 mlo_printing_press_desc: "During the 15th and 16th Century, the majority of peasants and citizens of each nation had little to no access to education.

 mlo_university_pavia_desc: "The spread of the Printing Press across our nation is a mere first step towards serving the people's thirst for knowledge and education.

 FU_Milan_Events.1.t: "Spinetta Campofregoso of Genoa"
 FU_Milan_Events.1.d: "Son of Spinetta I Fregoso and Benedetta Doria, and grandson of the former Doge Pietro Fregoso, he was born in the Genoese capital in a period around the early 15th Century. Despite the fact that his father exercised the role of podestà of Pera and then later as consul in Caffa, on behalf of the Republic of Genoa, Spinetta Fregoso spent his childhood and part of his adolescence in Genoa. \n\nFollowing the conquest of Genoa by our forces, he was installed as a puppet Doge on the vacant office of the Genoese Republic as a means to prevent future rebellions against Milanese authority." 
 FU_Milan_Events.1.a: "He will make a fine head of state, under our influence."
 
 FU_Milan_Events.2.t: "Academy of Bologna" 
 FU_Milan_Events.2.d: "The date of the University of Bologna's founding is uncertain, but believed by most accounts to have been 1088 and it was granted a charter (Authentica habita) by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa in 1158. \n\nHowever, the development of the institution at Bologna into a university was a gradual process. Paul Grendler writes that “it is not likely that enough instruction and organization existed to merit the term university before the 1150s, and it might not have happened before the 1180s.” \n\nThe university is historically notable for its teaching of canon and civil law; indeed, it was set up in large part with the aim of studying the Digest, a central text in Roman law, which had been rediscovered in Italy in 1070, and the university was central in the development of medieval Roman law. Until modern times, the only degree granted at that university was the doctorate. Bettisia Gozzadini earned a law degree in 1237, being one of the first women in history to obtain a university degree. She taught law from her own home for two years, and in 1239 she taught at the university, becoming the first woman in history to teach at a university. \n\nIn 1477, when Pope Sixtus IV issued a papal bull, authorizing the creation of Uppsala University in Sweden, the bull specified that the new university would have the same freedoms and privileges as the University of Bologna - a highly desirable situation for the Swedish scholars. This included the right of Uppsala to establish the four traditional faculties of theology, law (Canon Law and Roman law), medicine, and philosophy, and to award the bachelor's, master's, licentiate, and doctoral degrees."
 FU_Milan_Events.2.a: "I hear the class of [GetYear] exceeded our expectations!"
 
 FU_Milan_Events.3.t: "Port of Napoli" 
 FU_Milan_Events.3.d: "The foundation of Naples and its port unquestionably dates back to the period of Greek colonisation; in the ninth century B.C. a group of sailors from Rhodes reached this part of the coast and, between the seventh and sixth centuries B.C., the Greek colony was founded on the Acropolis of Pizzofalcone. \n\nIt was under Norman rule that the port enjoyed a period of great splendour becoming the only one of the Italian marine republics to join the famous Lega della Compagnia, known as the “Hanseatic cities”. The period of Norman rule brought Naples and its port a period of successes in maritime affairs and sea traffic. However, it was with the Anjovins in the second half of the thirteenth century, and in particular during the reign of Charles I of Anjou, that the port expanded and it acquired new buildings, while the city became the most heavily populated and admired city in Europe. The fortification of the port and the construction of warehouses, storage depots and factories continued under Aragonese rule (fifteenth century) and under the Spanish viceroy." 
 FU_Milan_Events.3.a: "Let us restore the port of Naples and use it to legitimize further conquest!"
 FU_Milan_Events.4.t: "Sforza's Monetary Reforms" 
 FU_Milan_Events.4.d: "Within the duchy of Milan, the Sforza family sought to maintain its newly acquired power by appealing to the people. Francesco (Duke 1450–1466) provided his subjects not only relative peace and patronage of humanism and the arts but also the disadvantages of tyrannical rule. \n\nAlong with these innovations, he ushered in the era of a new taxation system, free of bureaucratic red tape while reducing interest rates for upcoming landowners and newly-formed businesses in the commercial sector."
 FU_Milan_Events.4.a: "Let there be money!"
 FU_Milan_Events.5.t: "Palazzo Reale di Milano" 
 FU_Milan_Events.5.d: "The Royal Palace of Milan (Italian: Palazzo Reale di Milano) was the seat of government in the Italian city of Milan for many centuries. It was originally designed to include two courtyards but these were later dismantled to make room for the Duomo. The Palazzo is located to the right of the Duomo's facade, opposite to Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II. The facade of the Palazzo creates a recess in Piazza del Duomo which functions as a courtyard, known as the Piazzetta Reale (literally, a "Small Royal Square"). \n\nThe royal palace has ancient origins. It was first called "Palazzo del Broletto Vecchio", and it was the seat of city's government during the period of medieval communes in the Middle Ages. The palace became a key political center under the Torriani, Visconti and Sforza households. After the construction of the Duomo Cathedral, the Palazzo was heavily renovated thanks to the efforts of Francesco Sforza's government." 
 FU_Milan_Events.5.a: "A palace to match the grandeur of §Y[Root.Monarch.GetName]§!."
 FU_Milan_Events.6.t: "A Game of Crowns" 
 FU_Milan_Events.6.d: "Centuries have passed since the commemoration of the last Lormbard King, After a multitude of struggles and political manoeuvring we finally possess the necessary political capital to declare that Lombardy is not only reinstated but also more powerful than ever. Let us go forth and reclaim our long lost splendour and legacy!" 
 FU_Milan_Events.6.a: "Let us reclaim what once was ours!"
 FU_Milan_Events.6.b: "Let us stand firm with the times, instead."
 FU_Milan_Events.6.c: "The way forward is paved of the people - by the people!"
 FU_Milan_Events.7.t: "The Milano Ultimatum" 
 FU_Milan_Events.7.d: "News have arrived from the royal court of Milan. The head of state demands we immediately release our provinces on the bordering area of Tirol. According to the official letter the aforementioned lands will be put under Milanese protection as a sign of good faith and cooperation between the Austrian and Milanese crowns." 
 FU_Milan_Events.7.a: "We must accept." 
 FU_Milan_Events.7.b: "The musings of mice do not affect lions."
 FU_Milan_Events.8.t: "Pinacoteca e Biblioteca Ambrosiana" 
 FU_Milan_Events.8.d: "The Biblioteca Ambrosiana is a historic library in Milan, Italy, also housing the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana, the Ambrosian art gallery. Named after Ambrose, the patron saint of Milan, it was founded in 1609 by Cardinal Federico Borromeo, whose agents scoured Western Europe and even Greece and Syria for books and manuscripts. Some major acquisitions of complete libraries were the manuscripts of the Benedictine monastery of Bobbio (1606) and the library of the Paduan Vincenzo Pinelli, whose more than 800 manuscripts filled 70 cases when they were sent to Milan and included the famous Iliad, the Ilias Picta. \n\nDuring Cardinal Borromeo's sojourns in Rome, 1585–95 and 1597–1601, he envisioned developing this library in Milan as one open to scholars and that would serve as a bulwark of Catholic scholarship in the service of the Counter-Reformation against the treatises issuing from Protestant presses. To house the cardinal's 15,000 manuscripts and twice that many printed books, construction began in 1603 under designs and direction of Lelio Buzzi and Francesco Maria Richini. When its first reading room, the Sala Fredericiana, opened to the public on 8 December 1609 it was one of the earliest public libraries. One innovation was that its books were housed in cases ranged along the walls, rather than chained to reading tables, the latter a medieval practice seen still today in the Laurentian Library of Florence. A printing press was attached to the library, and a school for instruction in the classical languages." 
 FU_Milan_Events.8.a: "Come one, come all! Culture and knowledge for the masses!"
 FU_Milan_Events.10.t: "Milaner Wealth Display"
 FU_Milan_Events.10.d: "Milan's fashion history has evolved greatly throughout the years. Milan began as a centre of fashion in the Middle Ages and Renaissance, as in Venice and Florence, the making of luxury goods was an industry of such importance that in the 16th century the city gave its name to the English word "milaner" or "millaner", meaning fine wares like jewellery, cloth, hats and luxury apparel. By the 19th century, a later variant, "millinery", had come to mean one who made or sold hats. \n\nLater in the early 19th century cheaper silk began to be imported from Asia and the pest phylloxera damaged silk and wine production. More land was subsequently given over to industrialisation. Textile production was followed by metal and mechanical and furniture manufacture. In 1865, the first major department store in the country opened in Milan by the Bocconi brothers (which was called Alle Città d'Italia). This was regarded as a novelty at the time with regards to retailing in Italy. Though, traditionally, artisans would sell the items they made directly or to small stores, the opening of these new department stores modernised the distributions of clothes in the city."
 FU_Milan_Events.10.a: "One is never over-dressed or under-dressed with a little black dress."
 FU_Milan_Events.11.t: "The Milano Gazette" 
 FU_Milan_Events.11.d: "Milano was the first gazette published in the city of Milan. The first known number still in existence is dated 28 November 1640, but it is probable that the printing started some months before. As all the newspapers of such time, it derived directly from hand-writing newssheets. It is probable, but it is not verified, that the editor of the Milano was Filippo Velasca who during the 1640s was a compiler of handwritten Avvisi in Milan. \n\nSince 1640 the typographer was surely the Malatesta family who continued to publish it for all the life of the newspaper. The Malatestas were the official printer of the government in Duchy of Milan, having the monopoly of the official publications. They succeeded to pass this privilege for many generations, from Panfolfo (fl. 1594—1626) to Giulio Cesare (fl. 1635—1664), Giovanni Battista (fl. 1635—1654), Marc'Antonio Pandolfo (fl. 1664—1715) who in January 1672 started to print his name in the last page of the newspaper, and finally his nephew, Giuseppe Richini Malatesta (born in 1694 and died in 1793). Due to their privilege of publishing, the Malatestas were like the voice of the Government." 
 FU_Milan_Events.11.a: "Bah! Everyone else is fake news!"
 FU_Milan_Events.12.t: "Milano Conservatories and Opera Houses"
 FU_Milan_Events.12.d: "La Scala, an abbreviation in Italian of the official name Teatro alla Scala is an opera house in Milan, Italy. The theatre was inaugurated on 3 August 1778 and was originally known as the Nuovo Regio Ducale Teatro alla Scala (New Royal-Ducal Theatre alla Scala). The premiere performance was Antonio Salieri's Europa riconosciuta. \n\nMost of Italy's greatest operatic artists, and many of the finest singers from around the world, have appeared at La Scala. The theatre is regarded as one of the leading opera and ballet theatres in the world and is home to the La Scala Theatre Chorus, La Scala Theatre Ballet, La Scala Theatre Orchestra, and the Filarmonica della Scala orchestra. The theatre also has an associate school, known as the La Scala Theatre Academy (Italian: Accademia Teatro alla Scala), which offers professional training in music, dance, stage craft and stage management. \n\nDuring Mozart's first tour, his performances were well received, and his compositional talents recognised by commissions to write three operas for Milan's Teatro Regio Ducale, each of which was a critical and popular triumph. He met many of Italy's leading musicians, including the renowned theorist Giovanni Battista Martini, under whom he studied in Bologna.\n\nEvery level of our special §YComposer§! Advisor will also grant §G+0.5 Diplomatic Reputation§!" 
 FU_Milan_Events.12.a: "'The music is not in the notes, but in the silence between.'"
 FU_Milan_Events.13.t: "Santa Maria delle Grazie"
 FU_Milan_Events.13.d: "Originally ordered into construction by the famous Duke Ludoviko Sforza, the church was built upon an old gothic chapel and later became the official burial site of the entire Sforza dynasty. Adorned by a beautiful crossing and an exquisite dome, the church was designed by Donato Bramante. \n \nIn 1543, the Titian altarpiece depicting Christ receiving the crown of thorns was installed in the Chapel of the Holy Crown, located on the right of the nave. The painting, looted by French troops in 1797, it would later reside at the Louvre. This chapel is frescoed with Stories of the Passion by Gaudenzio Ferrari. In the small cloister adjacent to the tribune near the door that leads to the sacristy is a fresco by Bramantino. The church also contained frescoes depicting the Resurrection and Passion by Bernardo Zenale." 
 FU_Milan_Events.13.a: "What a magnificent display of faith!"
 FU_Milan_Events.14.t: "Santa Maria alla Fontana"
 FU_Milan_Events.14.d: "This beautiful declaration of piety is located just outside the city center and it is traditionally attributed to  Giovanni Antonio Amadeo, serving as both a gathering point for the believers and a sanctuary, a place of great healing. The oldest part is at the back and is made up of the shrine erected in 1507 by the will of the governor, Charles d'Amboise, who believed it to be miraculous and at that time attracted many sick andpilgrims. \nThis older part is characterized by a structure with massive pillars and arches on slender columns. Contrary to what has long been believed, the source of water in the premises of the church had little healing attributes and was merely exceptionally clean for its time, residing in an astonishing naturally-formed spring. A steep staircase connects this evocative original nucleus to the church above, built between 1547-1623." 
 FU_Milan_Events.14.a: "These waters befit royalty!"
 FU_Milan_Events.15.t: "Santa Maria Presso San Calso"
 FU_Milan_Events.15.d: "The construction was begun by Gian Giacomo Dolcebuono and Giovanni Battagioin 1493, to house a miraculous icon of the Madonna, initially on the central plan. The first part to be built was the octagonal dome, covered externally by a tambour with a loggia and arcades decorated by twelve brickwork statues by Agostino De Fondulis, designed in Lombard style by Giovanni Antonio Amadeo.\nSome time later, the square portico in classical style was added, perhaps designed by Cesare Cesariano or Cristoforo Lombardo (il Lombardino). The massive eclectic and Mannerist style facade was designed by Galeazzo Alessi in the late 16th century and was realized by Martino Bassi. It is decorated by numerous statues and reliefs by Stoldo Lorenzi and Annibale Fontana. The interior houses numerous works by Milanese Renaissance and Baroque artists: Giovan Battista Crespi (il Cerano), Camillo and Giulio Cesare Procaccini, Carlo Francesco Nuvolone, Antonio Campi, Bergognone, Callisto Piazza and others. \nNotable are the Baptism of Jesus by Gaudenzio Ferrari and Giovan Battista della Cerva, the Fall of St. Paul by Moretto and, on the altar of the right transept, an altarpiece by Paris Bordone. The lectern of the choir is by Giuseppe Meda and on the left transept, within an altar designed by Martino Bassi, is the venerated marble statue of the Assunta by Annibale Fontana with two later angels by Giulio Cesare Procaccini.""
 FU_Milan_Events.15.a: "May our legacy shine for millenia to come!" 
 FU_Milan_Events.16.t: "San Fedele a Milano"
 FU_Milan_Events.16.d: "San Fedele is a Jesuit church in Milan, northern Italy. It is entitled to St. Fidelis of Como, patron of the Catholic diocese of Como. \nLocated in Saint Fedele Square in the centre of the city, the church was commissioned by Charles Borromeo from Pellegrino Tibaldi in 1559. The interior is on a single nave, with tall columns in granite. The presbytery was prolonged in the 17th century by Francesco Maria Richino,who also designed the notable sacristy. The facade was completed byPietro Pestagalli from Tibaldi's designs much later. \nIt features a group of Gaetano Matteo Monti's statues representing the Assumption. The interior is decorated with artworks that include a Pieta by Simone Peterzano, a St. Ignatius by Giovanni Battista Crespi (il Cerano) a Transfiguration by Bernardino Campi, and a "Sacred Heart" by Lucio Fontana."

 sic_isle_of_malta_desc: "The island fell in 870 under the rule of the Arabs, who eliminated almost all the original inhabitants and repopulated the archipelago, building the new capital Mdina on the site of the previous Roman city of Melita. The new rulers introduced the cultivation of cedar and cotton, built an irrigation system and, in particular, the Arabic language, which most of the population adopted as their mother tongue. Its influence in modern Maltese is easily found, as well as the presence of words of Latin origin and of the Latin alphabet. The Arab domination lasted for about two centuries, from 870 to 1091, during which Islam became the main religion on the island (although Christians were allowed to practice their worship). \nThe period of Arab domination ended in 1091 when the island was conquered by the Normans from the Kingdom of Sicily, at the helm of Ruggero d'Altavilla. The archipelago thus entered the Sicilian orbit, and was placed under the control of the members of the Norman house of Sicily, although in fact it was a little more than nominal control. In 1191 Margarito of Brindisi landed again on the island and was appointed first count of Malta. The ties of the island with Sicily consequently became ever closer, and the fiefdom was subsequently granted to the families of the highest Sicilian nobility."

In defense of his wife, the groom managed to steal the sword from the soldier and kill him. This gesture constituted the spark that started the revolt. In the course of the evening and the night that followed the people of Palermo - with the cry of "Mora, mora!" - they indulged in a real "hunt for the Aragonese" which quickly spread throughout the island, becoming a carnage.

The greatest artists of the period are Gaspare da Pesaro and his son Guglielmo Pesaro. \nIn architecture, the intense construction activity is characterized by its adherence to late Gothic forms with the Iberian mark (especially in the Val di Noto), and by the persistence of decorations and planimetric motifs that have been repeated since the Norman era. \nPalermo and Messina, among the main cities, went through a phase of demographic and economic growth in the fifteenth century thanks to the presence of the port and numerous communities of Pisan, Venetian, Lombard and Genoese merchants. Even the social structure of the city was renewed with a class of officials and merchants who joined the nobility by building noble palaces and chapels and requesting refined artifacts of great value. \nThese premises, thanks to the arrival of numerous artists of the peninsula and the influence of the Neapolitan artistic environment of the Alfonso II period, allowed the renewal of the artistic language in Sicily."

 ME_Sicily_Events.1.D: "The city of Drepanum has a long story of being the shield of the Island against foreign armies, The important strategic position was used during the First Punic War when the Carthaginians defeated the Roman fleet in the Battle of Trapani in 249 BC. Thus the Romans conquered the city, latinizing its name in Drepanum. \nAfter the Romans, the Vandals, then the Byzantines dominated the city, but it was in the 9th century AD. with the Arabs (who called it Itràbinis, Taràbanis, Tràpanesch) and with the Normans (who conquered it in 1077 led by Roger I) that the city reached a fervent development, thriving in trade and cultural activities, so the port had great turmoil also thanks to the crusades. The port of Trapani, during the Middle Ages, was one of the most important in the Mediterranean: all the most powerful seaside cities (Genoa, Pisa, Venice, Amalfi) had a consulate in the Trapani port and, especially with the first two, Trapani had the agreement to act as a stopover for their possessions in North Africa. \nIn 1266 the Venetian and Genoese fleets collided in front of the port of Trapani during the San Saba war. The Venetians captured the entire Genoese fleet. \nAfter a short period under the Angevins, Trapani actively participated in the uprising of the Sicilian Vespers led by Palmiero Abate, passing to the Aragonese in 1282. During the 14th and 15th centuries the city grew and became the most economically and politically important center of western Sicily. In 1443, from simple Earth it became Civitas. Ferdinand the Catholic granted the city the title of Invittissima in this regard of the glorious resistance always made to the enemies of the kingdom."

His works for the commissions of the island and his definitive return home represented the first affirmation of Renaissance painting on the island, thanks to a crowded laboratory that introduced the new taste for the human figure, the pictorial genre of the portrait into traditional production. and a new role of the artist are no longer just an anonymous craftsman. \nAmong the most interesting artists active in Messina Giorgio da Milano, Andrea Mancino, Bernardino Nobile and the Carrarese Giovan Battista Mazzolo, owner of an important workshop, which was joined by Messina Antonio Freri (also active in Catania), without count the presence of Antonello Gagini, son of Domenico, in Messina. As in Palermo, these Tuscan and Lombard artists brought in the city and its surroundings to Calabria, the rich repertoire of classicist architectural decorations. However, throughout the fifteenth century, despite some obsolete interpretations, the architecture continued to follow the late Gothic tradition despite the presence of Renaissance decorative episodes. \nThe renewal of language therefore did not immediately involve the entire building organization. The main Sicilian architect of the fifteenth century was in fact Matteo Carnilivari who used a personal language with Gothic and Catalan elements, as in the church of Santa Maria della Catena in Palermo. His prestige as a builder was one of the obstacles to the affirmation of the Renaissance language, outside the decorative repertoire of marble workers. In addition to the few traces left by Laurana, at the end of the fifteenth century, the Renaissance language can be found only in minor episodes such as the Ventimiglia chapel in the church of San Francesco in Castelbuono."

The Templar possessions were organized into eight \"Languages\" (Auvergne, Aragon, Castile, France, Germany, England, Italy and Provence). Once in Rhodes, and now known as the Knights of Rhodes, they were forced to develop above all the military side of their business, engaging above all against the Berber corsairs. During the 15th century, the Hospitallers victoriously opposed two invasion attempts: one in 1440 by the Mamluk sultan of Egypt, the second in 1480 by the Ottoman sultan Muhammad II, who, after the fall of Constantinople saw one of his main enemies in the Knights of the Sovereign Order of St. John of Jerusalem. \nEscaping and trying to rebuilding a crusading fortress in the east they asked for the island of Malta to be their new starting ground."

Also important were the cultivation of citrus fruits and many other plants suitable for the Mediterranean climate, such as the olive tree, the vine, the fig, the cherry, the chestnut, the hazelnut, the walnut and the almond tree.

He easily submits to discipline, when this moves from a just power, strong and constant. The elementary education of the different weapons is excellent: they maneuver exactly and promptly, both separate and united; The Neapolitan and Sicilian military institutions boast a much older history, which has its foundations in the organization of a "state-owned" (ie state and no longer feudal) army by Ferrante d Aragon in 1464. In particular, the Spanish viceregal period (1503-1714) profoundly marked the military customs of the subsequent Bourbon period. During this time the soldiers of southern Italy were in fact involved in almost all the military events of the Spanish Empire (from the wars of Charles V to the wars of Flanders, from the colonial campaigns in America to the thirty years war), often giving proof of great value and loyalty to the imperial authorities. The captains, belonging to the best feudal nobility of the Neapolitan and Sicilian provinces, were able to frame and prepare the subjects of the two viceroys for war, obeying the firm political direction given by the monarchs of Spain."

Place of origin of the Latin language, it was the capital of the Roman Empire which extended its dominion over the whole Mediterranean basin and most of Europe, the Papal States, subjected to the temporal power of the popes and the future Kingdom of Italy.

 tts_protecting_sea_zones_desc: "The merchant navy was made up almost entirely of small woods, good for cabotage and fishing, and more than 40,000 sailors mounted it, a number inadequate for the tonnage of the ships. Navigation was limited to the coasts of the Adriatic and the Mediterranean, and the slow progress of the maritime forces did not consist in decreasing the number of logs and increasing their range, but in multiplying the small ships. The steam merchant navy was very scarce, despite the fact that one of the first steamships, which plowed the waters of the Mediterranean, was built in Naples in 1818. It apparently seemed the largest in Italy, while in reality the Sardinian was inferior, and also as a warship, it was scarce for a Kingdom, of which the third part was formed by Sicily and the other two thirds formed a large pier launched towards the Levant. The navy and the army were at the antipodes: the army was disproportionate to the country for exuberance, the navy for deficiency."

The gardens are beautiful and harmonize very much with this district which is a single garden. \nThe Royal Palace of Caserta was wanted by the King of Sicily [Root.Monarch.GetName], who, taken from a competition with the French royals and eager to donate structures to Naples that could play the role of the capital city of European level, he decided to inaugurate a palace that could rival in magnificence and grandeur with those of the European capitals. For safety reasons, the chosen location was Casertavecchia about 15 km north of the capital. \nThe king asked that the project include, in addition to the palace, the park and the arrangement of the surrounding urban area, with the supply from a new aqueduct (Acquedotto Carolino) that would cross the annexed complex of San Leucio. The new palace was to be a symbol of the new Bourbon state and to show power and grandeur, but also to be efficient and rational. \nThe project was part of the broader political plan of king [Root.Monarch.GetName], who probably also wanted to move some administrative structures of the state to the new Royal Palace, connecting it to the capital Naples with a monumental avenue of over 15 km."
 tts_maschio_angioino_title: "Maschio Angioino"
 tts_maschio_angioino_desc: "The presence of an external monarchy had set the urban planning of Naples around the center of royal power, constituting an alternative urban center, formed by the port and the two main adjacent castles, Castel Capuano and Castel dell'Ovo. This relationship between the royal court and town planning had already manifested itself with Frederick II, who in the 13th century, in the Swabian statute, had concentrated the greatest attention on castles, neglecting the city walls at all. To the two existing castles the Angevins added the main one, Castel Nuovo (Chastiau neuf), which was not only a fortification but above all their grandiose palace. \nThe royal residence of Naples had until then been Castel Capuano, but the ancient Norman fortress was judged inadequate for its function and the king wanted to build a new castle near the sea. \nAssigned the project to the French architect Pierre de Chaulnes, the works for the construction of the Castrum Novum began in 1279 and ended just three years later, a very short time given the construction techniques of the time and the overall size of the work. However, the king never resided there: following the revolt of the Sicilian Vespers, which cost Angioino the crown of Sicily, conquered by Peter III of Aragon and other events, the new palace remained unused until 1285, the year of his death. by Carlo I. \nAlfonso of Aragon, who had conquered the throne of Naples in 1443, wanted to establish in the castle the function of the center of royal power and a court of magnificence that could compete with that of Lorenzo the Magnificent in Florence. The fortress was completely rebuilt in its present form. King Alfonso entrusted the renovation of the old Angevin palace-fortress to an Aragonese architect, Guillem Sagrera, a Catalan from Mallorca, who conceived it in Gothic-Catalan terms. \nThe five round towers, four of which incorporated the previous Angevin towers with a square plan, more suitable for withstanding the shots of the guns of the time, reaffirmed the defensive role of the castle. The importance of the building as a center of royal power was instead underlined by the insertion of the triumphal arch at its entrance, a masterpiece of the Neapolitan Renaissance and the work of Francesco Laurana as well as many artists of various origins."

The peace of Caltabellotta, in 1302, sanctioned the end of the war and gave the aforementioned separation (according to the agreements, on the death of the Aragonese king Frederick of Aragon, the island should have returned to the Angevins, which in reality did not happen)."

Godfrey, after renouncing the royal title, obtained that of Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri (Protector of the Holy Sepulcher) and was crowned Governor of Jerusalem in the Basilica of the Nativity in Bethlehem. \nAt his death the following year, his brother Baldwin was the first of the rulers to be crowned with the title of king of Jerusalem. The ceremony took place in the Basilica of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem. The exact formula of the royal title was Rex Latinorum Hierosolymitanus, ie \"King of the Latins of Jerusalem\", meaning that the sovereign's jurisdiction did not include the native populations: Christian, Muslim and Jewish. \nThe succession to the throne of Jerusalem generally took place according to both hereditary and elective criteria. Even when the title was inherited within the same ruling family, the sovereign always received validation from the Jerusalem High Court. The king was in fact considered a primus inter pares (first among equals) rather than a real monarch, so much so that in his absence the functions of government were entrusted to his officers."

Having said these words, the Virgin disappeared and William, confident of the revelation in a dream, ordered that the carob be uprooted and dug around it.

 tts_parramentu_sicilianu_desc: "The Sicilian parliament was made up of three "branches" ("feudal", "ecclesiastical" and "state property"). The feudal branch was made up of the noble representatives of counties and baronies, the ecclesiastical branch was made up of archbishops, bishops, abbots and archimandrites, while the state branch was made up of representatives of the 42 state-owned cities of Sicily. The first Norman parliament was not deliberative, and had only a consultative and ratification function of the sovereign's activity, especially in taxation, in the economy and in the management of relations with foreign powers. The deputies were chosen from among the most powerful nobles. The first radical change took place with Frederick II of Swabia, who also allowed partial access to civil society, such as state-owned cities. Federico gathered a parliament in September 1221 in Messina known as the "Assise di Messina", where he proceeded to reorganize the legislation of the Regnum by promulgating a further nucleus of assisae, four or five, conceived to defend morality, order and "good customs "of the Kingdom", the first nucleus of those that in 1231 would have been promulgated in Melfi as Constitutionum Regni Siciliarum, then integrated into the Syracuse assembly in 1233."
 tts_university_federico_II_title: "Università Federico II"
 tts_university_federico_II_desc: "The erection of the Studium was decreed by Emperor Frederick II of Swabia on 5 June (5 July according to some sources) 1224 through a circular letter (generalis lictera) sent from Syracuse. Since it was created at the behest of the emperor, the University of Naples is considered by far the first lay university in Europe of a state type (not founded, that is, by corporations or associations of intellectuals, or students, but by virtue of a provision sovereign). \nInitially the studies were directed towards law (fundamental for the training of jurists), the liberal arts, medicine and theology: the latter, compared to other subjects, was taught in religious centers, in particular in the convent of San Domenico Maggiore , where Thomas Aquinas taught from 1271 to 1274. During the Angevin period (1265-1443) the structure and organization of the University remained substantially unchanged. \nFurthermore, during the Angevin period the University of Naples, unlike the others, remained independent from papal power: in fact, Charles I of Anjou reaffirmed and increased the previous privileges granted by the Swabian kings to the University. The first difficulties came with the advent of the Aragonese dominion in 1443, which in fact forced the university to a first closure."

We need to slow down and lessen the amount of damage our enemies can cause upon us in war. To do this we need to fortify every city of importance that exists in Westphalia.

Westphalia's stance on Reformation is a bit uncertain: It can be seen as beneficial for us to help Pope re-assert spiritual reign over the Germans or we may embrace the Reformation and liberate ourselves slowly piece-by-piece from the foreign Italians. Our path remains uncertain and is up to our Monarch to decide."

 WES_serfdom_title: "Abolish Serfdom"
 WES_serfdom_desc: "Serfdom, the bounding of a serf to an entity, who requires them to do hard work for meager reward, is a highly exploitative system. Sure, we could keep it, but it would be much better to just get rid of it."
 WES_patrimonial_courts_title: "Patrimonial Courts"
 WES_patrimonial_courts_desc: "Patrimonial courts are such courts that, under a noble's jurisdiction, resolve matters dealt with by local laws, often set by nobles and often at odds with the national. As part of tearing down current establishment, we must tear down these institutions as well."

 WES_modern_title: "Modern State"

 WES_fortify_desc: "While it would seem that our benevolent state has noone but enemies, that thought couldn't be more wrong. Any friend could be an enemy in hiding. We must keep our guard up."

 ROT_question_of_religion_title: "Question of Religion"
 ROT_question_of_religion_desc: "For centuries, the catholic church was an immovable force, that was being torn apart from the inside. Several antipopes and movements sprung up, trying to abolish the current hierarchy. Antipopes, hussitism, heresies... all of those inflicted heavy blows on the catholic church. Finally, the church has finally been fragmentized, as the Lutheran heresy is currently spreading."

 ROT_heilig_geist_spital_desc: "We already support the Franciscans, why don't we make an effort to show some support to other organizations as well?

 ROT_resist_subjugation_title: "Resist Subjugation"
 ROT_resist_subjugation_desc: "Independence is a value that invokes pride in all Rothenburgians, old or young. We shall not forfeit these values. In fact, we shall make sure we will never lose our autonomy in the empire, and we will show that Rothenburg is a mighty city after all."

 ME_Rothenburg_Events.2.d: "The Rothenburger Wine is the most excellent. Legend says that in upon capture of the city by foreign forces, the residents offered the enemy commander wine, so as to prevent their city from being pillaged and looted. The commander, put in jolly mood, said that the city would be spared, could the city muster an individual to drink it all in one go.

 FKN_build_an_army_title: "Fränkische Armee"
 FKN_build_an_army_desc: "Our aim is to achieve the unification of the duchies and bishoprics making up Franconia. Building up an army would help maintain our borders and expand into new lands. The future of Franconia depends on our willingness to take action, and therefore we must make sure we have enough forcess to do so!"
 FKN_conquer_nuremburg_title: "Keine Freien Städte Mehr"
 FKN_conquer_nuremburg_desc: "The city-state of Nuremburg is well defended; a great fortress makes up the exterior of the city itself. To control it will be a difficult task, that is no trick. Still, with proper execution of newly developed siege techniques, the walls of Nuremburg can be overcome, and we can use the vast fortress for our own purposes!"
 FKN_conquer_wurzburg_title: "Ecclesiastical Control"
 FKN_conquer_wurzburg_desc: "The Bishoprics of Wurzburg and Bamberg claim to be protected by God, but God alone will not save them from us. Their influence in Franconian politics is too big to go unchecked, so we have to make sure they are out of the picture before they become diplomatically dominant over the region."
 FKN_conquer_ansbach_title: "Subjugate the Margraves"
 FKN_conquer_ansbach_desc: "The House of Hohenzollern rules the quaint Duchy of Ansbach, and as such they have dynastic ties to Brandenburg, a far greater power than us. Their state is set to be under union with Brandenburg once their ruler dies, and so if we don't act fast we'll have to deal with a union. For the continued autonomy of Franconia, Ansbach must be eliminated."
 FKN_unifying_franconia_title: "Unifying Franconia"
 FKN_unifying_franconia_desc: "The time has finally come to unite the old Franconian Duchy of Charlemagne once again. The unification process has taken a toll on our men, our lands, our culture, and maybe even our faith. We have faced many foes, from the Austrians and Bavarians, to the Swabians and Westphalians. So with all the hardships overcome by our will, we can finally say Three Hurrahs for Franconia!"
 FKN_dux_francorum_title: "Dux Francorum"
 FKN_dux_francorum_desc: "For years, the Franconian people have been divided within the petty duchies of the Holy Roman Empire, and have started to lose their morale for a united Franconia. No longer shall our people be separated, and we can only enforce this by uniting the Franconian lands."
 FKN_strength_in_unity_title: "Strength in Unity"
 FKN_strength_in_unity_desc: "In order to mend this shattered empire, we must first start on a smaller scale. By uniting with our brothers we might stand a chance at greater prospects."
 FKN_recognition_of_emperor_title: "Zustimmung des Kaisers"
 FKN_recognition_of_emperor_desc: "One cannot survive in the Empire without certain privileges. Whereas a European king answers to naught but the Lord, we are subject to an earthly power's whims. The autonomy we do enjoy is provided by the Emperor... we would do well to stay in their good graces."
 FKN_growing_cities_title: "Accodomate the Cities"
 FKN_growing_cities_desc: "A duchy is merely the product of its subsidiary cities. Nowhere does this hold truer than in Germany, a region of rich history and culture. The cities provide all that we need to govern; we should keep them on a short leash with a steady hand."
 FKN_raubritter_title: "Deal with the Raubritter"
 FKN_raubritter_desc: "Men of great pedigree, by nature, hold great influence within Franconia. A disloyal nobility does not bode well for a nation, and we are no exception. For the duchy to run smoothly, these important landowners must have their appetite for power sated, at least temporarily. The support of the Raubritter shall serve us well."
 FKN_bavaria_title: "Against the Goliath"
 FKN_bavaria_desc: "To our south lies perhaps the most powerful of the Imperial Princes. The Bavarians have exerted their influence over us since time immemorial, making them the most pertinent threat to our political independence. The invasion shall begin soon, let our first strike be the last."
 FKN_saxony_title: "Across the Frankenwald"
 FKN_saxony_desc: "Man's tendency to dictate borders via geography certainly has its merits. The northern border with Saxony lies along the Frankenwald hills, which will be troublesome to attack across. Regardless, our army fears no mountain, much less a few petty hills. The Saxons shall know the taste of Franconian steel."
 FKN_west_franconia_title: "Ancestral Rights"
 FKN_west_franconia_desc: "As the claimants to the ancient Duchy of Franconia, we have a duty to the restoration of the duchy as a major player in the empire. This means expanding our borders to match those of our ancestral lands, which constitutes westward expansion into Electorate territory."
 FKN_capture_berlin_title: "Capture Berlin"
 FKN_capture_berlin_desc: "The Northern Wars with the Saxons have gone on long enough. We shall march across the March as Brandenburg watched helplessly, Franconian boots trampling their once great city. With this final attack, our main rival shall fall, and the strongest of the German peoples shall reign supreme."
 FKN_westphalia_title: "Saxon Stem Duchy"
 FKN_westphalia_desc: "The Saxons have huffed their last breath as our net is cast over the North German peoples. The eastern duchies have fallen, we must now see to the west and restore the Duchy of Saxony as a subservient entity."
 FKN_swabia_title: "Swabian Stem Duchy"
 FKN_swabia_desc: "Our southern flank has been somewhat secured after the fall of Bavaria, but we cannot rest on our laurels. The Swabians pose a significant threat. For the glory of Franconia, Swabia must fall, then rise once more under our banner."
 FKN_reformation_title: "Reformation in Franconia"
 FKN_reformation_desc: "The cardinals of Rome see fit to govern the spirit of Franconia. Whilst we pay fealty to a master, that master is not the Pope. The old man should stay out of our political affairs, and through reformation shall it happen, one way or another."
 FKN_bettenberger_taffelrunde_title: "Bettenberger Tafelrunde"
 FKN_bettenberger_taffelrunde_desc: "Our nation serves as a bastion of free thought for all of Germany, with intellectuals stifled by aristocratic greed. We should do well to establish a true round table for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], where each member may speak freely without fear of execution. Such an advisory board will catapult Franconian free thought into the modern era."
 FKN_estates_title: "Fränkische Stände"
 FKN_estates_desc: "A nation may only operate under the consent of its ruling factions. Franconia remains divided among such estates, with contests and squabbling dominating the political atmosphere. We should clearly define the rights and privileges of each estate so that we might achieve unity through internal peace. Such a task, however, requires careful consideration to each group's needs."
 FKN_bauernkrieg_title: "Bauernkrieg"
 FKN_bauernkrieg_desc: "The peasantry from across the Great Empire grows restless. Sparked by obscene taxation and levies, the Great Peasant War runs rampant, with countless serfs rising above their labor, only to be slaughtered at the hands of German nobles. We must see to a swift end to the suffering within our own borders."
 FKN_kleinstaaterei_title: "Consolidate Kleinstaaterei"
 FKN_kleinstaaterei_desc: "The Empire is, and has always been, a fragmented and decentralized muddle of dynastic and territorial squabbling. Whilst we have no stake in foreign affairs, internal struggles are our own to bear. As such, we must see to the wholehearted unification of Franconia from within."
 FKN_ritterschaften_title: "Curb the Ritterschaften"
 FKN_ritterschaften_desc: "Although vital to any functioning state, the aristocratic class of Franconia grows ambitious with time. Their influence reaches far, perhaps farther than our own [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Such a situation cannot subsist. Through careful politicking may we halt the coming storm of nightmarish bureaucracy."
 FKN_trade_center_title: "Franconian Trade Center"
 FKN_trade_center_desc: "Franconia has always played a large part in the Rhenish Trade Network, however in recent years we have found our mercantile performance to be lacking. We require a stronger grip on the region's trade, which will only come from careful investment in infrastructure by the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Not only Germans, but all of Europe will envy our grand monopolies."
 FKN_heritage_of_kilian_title: "St. Kilian's Patronage"
 FKN_heritage_of_kilian_desc: "Our devotion to the Lord and His emissaries knows no bounds. Saint Kilian, the Apostle of Franconia, was a model Christian, daring and stalwart in his faith. We would do well to follow suit and expand our earthly devotion."
 FKN_developing_land_title: "Developing Franconia"
 FKN_developing_land_desc: "These lands, scorched and blugeoned by war and famine, shall give rise to the new regional power of Germany. Before this ascension may occur, however, we must first see to the economic revitalization of Franconia, both physically and spiritually."
 FKN_capital_title: "Franconian Capital"
 FKN_capital_desc: "[Root.Capital.GetName] serves well as our seat of government, however we could do better. The recent economic boom Franconia has experienced shall give way to a glorious city at the center of Europe."
 FKN_universities_title: "Heart of Germany"
 FKN_universities_desc: "We are the beating heart of Germany, both geographically and intellectually. Franconian technology rises above our neighbors' in practicality, but we shan't rest on our laurels. Sponsoring the next generation of Germany's best and brightest shall bring us to the forefront of innovation."
 FKN_workshops_title: "Establish Workshops"
 FKN_workshops_desc: "Perhaps the most backwards system still embraced, feudalism is inherently wasteful of talent. Due to the particularly high dexterity of our workforce, it would be silly to subject the skilled serfs to servitude on the farms. We should open industrial opportunities so that our economy might prosper."
 FKN_franconian_beverages_title: "Franconian Beverages"
 FKN_franconian_beverages_desc: "Beer, wine, and everything in between. Franconia is known far and wide for the quality of our brew, and we should not let this opportunity go to waste. Our alcohol industry is booming, it would behoove us to invest."
 FKN_franconian_dominance_title: "Imperial Dominance"
 FKN_franconian_dominance_desc: "Truly the heart and soul of Germany, Franconia plays a large part in the Empire. But it could be larger. We shan't rest until our glorious nation is known far and wide for its rightful virtue and prestige in German politics. We shall establish ourselves as the foremost power in Germany!"
 FKN_manufactories_title: "Export Focus"
 FKN_manufactories_desc: "Largely relying on our neighbors for manufactured goods, we put a fair bit of needless strain on our backwards economy. The preferred flow of goods should be outwards, as dictated by the policies of mercantilism. To this end, we must ramp up production at home."
 FKN_hre_capital_title: "Imperial Capital"
 FKN_hre_capital_desc: "Seated at the center of the Empire, Nürnberg is perhaps the cultural and economic center of both Germany and the Franconian people. The Empire has known no true capital since the days of Otto; Nürnberg shall fill that void in all but formality."
 FKN_abase_loyalists_title: "Abase Loyalists"
 FKN_abase_loyalists_desc: "We must strike out while our bid for the Imperial Throne lays hidden from the public eye. It would do us well to deter the loyalist scum of the Electorship from interrupting us from our grand plans."
 FKN_support_title: "Attain Support"
 FKN_support_desc: "No emperor may stand strong without help from his supporters. In order to obtain the Emperorship through diplomatic means, we must first secure a decently-sized voter base to ensure the election proceeds in our favor."
 FKN_emperorship_title: "A Feather in Our Cap"
 FKN_emperorship_desc: "What a nice crown, what's next?"
 FKN_absolute_loyalty_title: "Absolute Loyalty"
 FKN_absolute_loyalty_desc: "For the Empire to stand strong, we cannot remain so divided. No matter how small, the threat of losing the Emperorship to some upstart will always remain. We must take the proper steps to ensure our empire remains whole and our popular support remains strong among the Electors."
 FKN_franconia_ascendant_title: "Franken Ascendant"
 FKN_franconia_ascendant_desc: "The glory of Franconia knows no bounds, nor does our propensity for honor and splendor. We represent the key shift in the political landscape that will bring the Holy Roman Empire to the forefront of world affairs. The Habsburg stranglehold over Germany has ended, and our reign will be eternal!"
 FKN_powerbase_title: "Acquire Powerbase"
 FKN_powerbase_desc: "No longer able to rely on the Habsburg army to defend the Empire, we must muster our courage and stand as both the bulwark of Germany and Christianity. We shall begin the levying of a grand army in defense of the fatherland and its bountiful lands."
 FKN_imperial_ban_title: "Restore the Borders"
 FKN_imperial_ban_desc: "The slow decline of the Empire has not gone unnoticed by the [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s careful eyes. The Habsburgs let the fatherland crumble beneath their boots; it is now our job to restore its glory, one province at a time. The Holy Roman Empire will know unity, one way or another."
 FKN_in_defense_title: "In Defensionem"
 FKN_in_defense_desc: "The main point of an army is not to do war, but to assure your enemies that they would be crushed, should they offer resistance. In its current state, our armed forces may stand grand, but we must amass such a force that even the might of the world could not stand in our way."
 FKN_imperial_enemies_title: "Imperial Enemies"
 FKN_imperial_enemies_desc: "Even now, there are those within the Empire that seek our removal from power. Unfortunately for them, strength of arms shall prove triumphant over politics. Our tremendous military power shall leave them trampled beneath our hooves as we sack their cities, proving Franconian dominance and unity to all that seek to oppose our might."
 FKN_grace_title: "Grace Entire Nations"
 FKN_grace_desc: "The seat of Emperor's strength goes beyond that of a mere nation within the Empire. None know true sovereignty under us, and we shall prove that. The power of the throne shall show our allies grace, just as it wreaks havoc among our enemies."
 FKN_reform_the_empire_title: "Reform the Empire"
 FKN_reform_the_empire_desc: "The state of the Empire, though not stagnant, has evolved far too slowly for our tastes. The disunified states must be brought together for the most important cause of all: servitude to the Emperor. The strength of the throne shall unite the scattered duchies, bishoprics, and republics of the Empire into one true nation."
 FKN_religious_peace_title: "Institute Religious Peace"
 FKN_religious_peace_desc: "Whilst the Pope maintains dominion over his Catholics, he holds no authority over our Empire. Religion is simply another part of administration, to which we hold sole authority over in our lands. The rule of law and the rule of God are closer than one might think."
 FKN_ensure_loyalty_title: "Imperial Cities"
 FKN_ensure_loyalty_desc: "The two integral cities of the Empire, Frankfurt and Aachen, provide legitimacy to each Emperor upon their ascension to the office. It is important that we ensure they support our righteous reign over the Empire and its people, lest questions arise of our rule."
