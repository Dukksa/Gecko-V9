 #Missions #LOC MADE BY MARCUS# ###HAHA FUNNY DOG!### #
 arl_mystic_order_title: "Mystic Order"
 arl_mystic_order_desc: "The urban sophisticates of Herat and Teheran read their manuscripts and sip their tea with the tip of Timur’s spear at their throats. And yet, they snidely mock us as backward hill people, living in dung and making carpets. Was Safi ad-Din not a great man? Did the angels not come to him and show him the will of the divine? If these men are to believe us to be barbarous, so be it. We shall fall upon them as ravenous wolves and instruct them on what it truly is to bask in the light of the Greatest."
 arl_successors_to_the_aswaran_title: "Successors of the Aswaran"
 arl_successors_to_the_aswaran_desc: "In our heart is the dream of there once again being a great Persian Empire, like those of old. All of Persia’s great empires have had one thing in common; fearsome cavalry. Even the Emperors of faraway Rome would tremble at the thought of the mighty Sassanian Aswaran. So shall they again."
 arl_revenge_for_haydar_title: "Revenge for Haydar"
 arl_revenge_for_haydar_desc: "Once the faithful wept for the passing of Haydar, he and his men cornered and slaughtered by the Shirvanshah. Now only righteous indignation burns in their hearts, that justice is wrought upon the Shirvani dogs that so cruelly beheaded a pious son of Safi. By the grace of God, it shall be done." 
 arl_many_capitals_title: "The Many Capitals"
 arl_many_capitals_desc: "Wise men have always said that Persia is a land of a thousand cities. Of course, some would say these statistics are inflated; however, the point remains true that our lands have many bountiful cities, grand and sprawling. Could it be said that we have only one capital?" 
 arl_cultural_shift_title: "Cultural Shift" 
 arl_cultural_shift_desc: "As we have expanded, so too has the number of different peoples under our rule. Prime among them are the Persians, and many of the administrators employed in our government are Persian. Many at court also prefer to speak Persian over our traditional Azeri tongue. We must decide the place of Persians in our administration." 
 arl_potent_salt_title: "Potent Salt"
 arl_potent_salt_desc: "Over the last decades, the fiery salts of China have become far more of a presence on the battlefield, both here and elsewhere. The Sons of Osman have built their great cannons that crumble a castle’s walls as though God Himself had brought this destruction. Rumors grace our ears that mines of Mianeh have produced the salts needed for wise men to create this salt. It would be a wonderful thing for us to have access to this resource."
 arl_a_new_challenger_approaches_title: "A New Challenger"
 arl_a_new_challenger_approaches_desc: "Many in the past have laughed at us. They said it was impossible for a small order such as ours to spread bountifully across the land, and yet God has willed it so. So let it be said that none dare laugh at us now. The Sons of Timur fight amongst themselves, thinking us not to be the threat that we are. They are fools, and they shall die fools. "
 arl_the_rise_of_the_safavids_title: "Rise of the Safavids"
 arl_the_rise_of_the_safavids_desc: "By the grace of God, we have spread our wings and flown as the eagle does. Soon we will be the masters of all Persia, Lord of the cities of Isfahan, Teheran, Qom, Qazvin, Shiraz, and Tabriz. Of course, with our rise comes important decisions to be made regarding a prime location for our capital."
 arl_spreading_twelver_islam_title: "Spreading Twelver Islam"
 arl_spreading_twelver_islam_desc: "Though our government has secularized somewhat as we have expanded beyond our original borders, our original mission of spreading the true word of God has not and cannot change. We have liberated many of the faithful in Persia, but now our mission must extend further than that. We must make war upon the unbelievers and show them the true light of heaven, even if it is done by the spilling of blood."
 arl_sheep_to_shepherds_title: "Sheep to Shepherds"
 arl_sheep_to_shepherds_desc: "Once, we were a mere footnote on the page of the world. Now, however, our name is known from the docks of Lisbon to the court of China. Our rise has been fast and dramatic, though none can deny that we are the true Masters of Persia and that all those lands which are not already ours soon will be. "
 arl_the_great_shahs_court_title: "The Great Shah's Court" 
 arl_the_great_shahs_court_desc: "Every great ruler requires a splendorous court. And our ruler, let it not go unsaid, is great. Therefore, we shall do as many others have done before and invite the world’s wisest men to serve under our Shah, from mystics to engineers. All will soon see that our Shah is a sophisticate and patron of the arts. " 
 arl_the_zaidist_school_title: "The Zaidist School" 
 arl_the_zaidist_school_desc: "It cannot be said that we agree upon everything with the Zaidis, though our disagreements are comparatively small. There is little doubt in the minds of the faithful that the Zaidis will quickly be brought into the fold and see the righteousness of our Sheikh." 
 arl_the_disgraced_title: "Fallen From Grace"
 arl_the_disgraced_desc: "Mazandaran is one of Persia’s most remote and fertile regions, and long has it been a place resistant to outside invasions. In the proceeding decades, however, under the mismanagement of the Mar’ashis the prosperity of this small slice of fertile land has faded. Perhaps it could once again prosper under our just and righteous rule."
 arl_legacy_of_the_silk_road_title: "Legacy of the Silk Road"
 arl_legacy_of_the_silk_road_desc: "It is true that in recent years, Persia’s economy has fallen on hard times. First, it was the invasion of the Mongols- sacking cities and filling irrigation ditches. Then, once their Empire fell, Timur Gurkani came and ransacked Persia once more. As a result, our once lucrative trade of silk has been dramatically disrupted, fabrics from elsewhere filling the courts of Europe. However, now that we have consolidated our rule over much of Persia, trade and silk production can resume again."

 #Events
 FU_Ardabil_Events.1.t: "Shirvanshah"
 FU_Ardabil_Events.1.d: "For many centuries, the rulers of Shirvan have taken the title of Shirvanshah, starting with the Yazidids, given the title by the Abbasid Caliph in the 9th century. The independence of Shirvan has waxed and waned, but the rulers have nonetheless styled themselves as such. We have seized our revenge for the murder of Sheikh Haydar, the city of Baku, and its surrounding lands now ours. The Derbendids have fled north of the Caucusus and pretend to the title of Shirvanshah still, though none can argue that it is not, in truth, ours."
 FU_Ardabil_Events.1.a: "I am the new Shirvanshah!"
 FU_Ardabil_Events.2.t: "Persian at Court" 
 FU_Ardabil_Events.2.d: "The use of the Persian language at our court has been increasing steadily as our state has expanded over the Persian heartlands, likewise have the number of Persians employed in our bureaucracy. The core of our oldest and most loyal retainers, however, are Azeri. The tensions between these two groups have increased steadily, and before it reaches a breaking point, we must decide which language- and which culture- is promoted in our government." 
 FU_Ardabil_Events.2.a: "Persian is nice..."
 FU_Ardabil_Events.2.b: "But I prefer Azerbaijani!"
 FU_Ardabil_Events.3.t: "Capital of Choice"
 FU_Ardabil_Events.3.d: "All great Persian Empires have had glorious capitals as their crowning jewel. If we are to take on this legacy for ourselves, we must likewise have our capital city be a place of unparalleled glory and beauty. Our dynasty has for centuries now made its home in the mountainous city of Ardabil. Once a mere town, it has grown into a sprawling city and is an excellent candidate to be our capital as we ascend to greatness. "
 FU_Ardabil_Events.3.a: "Our old capital will do just nicely "
 FU_Ardabil_Events.3.b: "Qazvin will be the perfect place for the Shah's court "
 FU_Ardabil_Events.3.c: "Qazvin is the obvious choice, for its trade opportunities "
 FU_Ardabil_Events.5.t: "Taking up the Mantle"
 FU_Ardabil_Events.5.d: "The lands north of the Alborz mountains were the last in Persia to fall to Islamic rule, being viciously defended by their Bavandid and Karen rulers. As a result, it is only in the previous century that Muslims have made up the majority of the population, and a sizeable minority of Zoroastrians remain. \n\nThe Mazandaranis last memories of a Persian Empire was that of the House of Sassan, and though they were heathen, we cannot deny their greatness. Indeed it may lend our cause some amount of prestige were we to take on the mantle of the Sassanids, and of course, it would strengthen our support amongst the Zoroastrians of Mazandaran."
 FU_Ardabil_Events.5.a: "Destroy their legacy and create our own"
 FU_Ardabil_Events.5.b: "The Sassanids were a Persian house, let their legacy live through us"
 FU_Ardabil_Events.6.t: "Ismail Safavid"
 FU_Ardabil_Events.6.d: "One of our young Princes has begun to show great promise, even though he is but a youth of five. He takes to his lessons well, all of his tutors singing the boy’s praises, and he has even started writing poetry. \n\nIt would not be unreasonable to make young Ismail heir to the throne, given how promising he seems to be compared to other candidates for the position. Such a decision could be controversial, though, to say the least."
 FU_Ardabil_Events.6.a: "He will make a fine heir!"
 FU_Ardabil_Events.6.b: "We will not deny our eldest his birthright!"

 FU_Milan_Events.1.t: "Spinetta Campofregoso of Genoa"
 FU_Milan_Events.1.d: "Son of Spinetta I Fregoso and Benedetta Doria, and grandson of the former Doge Pietro Fregoso, he was born in the Genoese capital in a period around the early 15th Century. Despite the fact that his father exercised the role of podestà of Pera and then later as consul in Caffa, on behalf of the Republic of Genoa, Spinetta Fregoso spent his childhood and part of his adolescence in Genoa. \n\nFollowing the conquest of Genoa by our forces, he was installed as a puppet Doge on the vacant office of the Genoese Republic as a means to prevent future rebellions against Milanese authority." 
 FU_Milan_Events.1.a: "He will make a fine head of state, under our influence."
 
 FU_Milan_Events.2.t: "Academy of Bologna" 
 FU_Milan_Events.2.d: "The date of the University of Bologna's founding is uncertain, but believed by most accounts to have been 1088 and it was granted a charter (Authentica habita) by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa in 1158. \n\nHowever, the development of the institution at Bologna into a university was a gradual process. Paul Grendler writes that “it is not likely that enough instruction and organization existed to merit the term university before the 1150s, and it might not have happened before the 1180s.” \n\nThe university is historically notable for its teaching of canon and civil law; indeed, it was set up in large part with the aim of studying the Digest, a central text in Roman law, which had been rediscovered in Italy in 1070, and the university was central in the development of medieval Roman law. Until modern times, the only degree granted at that university was the doctorate. Bettisia Gozzadini earned a law degree in 1237, being one of the first women in history to obtain a university degree. She taught law from her own home for two years, and in 1239 she taught at the university, becoming the first woman in history to teach at a university. \n\nIn 1477, when Pope Sixtus IV issued a papal bull, authorizing the creation of Uppsala University in Sweden, the bull specified that the new university would have the same freedoms and privileges as the University of Bologna - a highly desirable situation for the Swedish scholars. This included the right of Uppsala to establish the four traditional faculties of theology, law (Canon Law and Roman law), medicine, and philosophy, and to award the bachelor's, master's, licentiate, and doctoral degrees."
 FU_Milan_Events.2.a: "I hear the class of [GetYear] exceeded our expectations!"
 
 FU_Milan_Events.3.t: "Port of Napoli" 
 FU_Milan_Events.3.d: "The foundation of Naples and its port unquestionably dates back to the period of Greek colonisation; in the ninth century B.C. a group of sailors from Rhodes reached this part of the coast and, between the seventh and sixth centuries B.C., the Greek colony was founded on the Acropolis of Pizzofalcone. \n\nIt was under Norman rule that the port enjoyed a period of great splendour becoming the only one of the Italian marine republics to join the famous Lega della Compagnia, known as the “Hanseatic cities”. The period of Norman rule brought Naples and its port a period of successes in maritime affairs and sea traffic. However, it was with the Anjovins in the second half of the thirteenth century, and in particular during the reign of Charles I of Anjou, that the port expanded and it acquired new buildings, while the city became the most heavily populated and admired city in Europe. The fortification of the port and the construction of warehouses, storage depots and factories continued under Aragonese rule (fifteenth century) and under the Spanish viceroy." 
 FU_Milan_Events.3.a: "Let us restore the port of Naples and use it to legitimize further conquest!"
 FU_Milan_Events.4.t: "Sforza's Monetary Reforms" 
 FU_Milan_Events.4.d: "Within the duchy of Milan, the Sforza family sought to maintain its newly acquired power by appealing to the people. Francesco (Duke 1450–1466) provided his subjects not only relative peace and patronage of humanism and the arts but also the disadvantages of tyrannical rule. \n\nAlong with these innovations, he ushered in the era of a new taxation system, free of bureaucratic red tape while reducing interest rates for upcoming landowners and newly-formed businesses in the commercial sector."
 FU_Milan_Events.4.a: "Let there be money!"
 FU_Milan_Events.5.t: "Palazzo Reale di Milano" 
 FU_Milan_Events.5.d: "The Royal Palace of Milan (Italian: Palazzo Reale di Milano) was the seat of government in the Italian city of Milan for many centuries. It was originally designed to include two courtyards but these were later dismantled to make room for the Duomo. The Palazzo is located to the right of the Duomo's facade, opposite to Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II. The facade of the Palazzo creates a recess in Piazza del Duomo which functions as a courtyard, known as the Piazzetta Reale (literally, a "Small Royal Square"). \n\nThe royal palace has ancient origins. It was first called "Palazzo del Broletto Vecchio", and it was the seat of city's government during the period of medieval communes in the Middle Ages. The palace became a key political center under the Torriani, Visconti and Sforza households. After the construction of the Duomo Cathedral, the Palazzo was heavily renovated thanks to the efforts of Francesco Sforza's government." 
 FU_Milan_Events.5.a: "A palace to match the grandeur of §Y[Root.Monarch.GetName]§!."
 FU_Milan_Events.6.t: "A Game of Crowns" 
 FU_Milan_Events.6.d: "Centuries have passed since the commemoration of the last Lormbard King, After a multitude of struggles and political manoeuvring we finally possess the necessary political capital to declare that Lombardy is not only reinstated but also more powerful than ever. Let us go forth and reclaim our long lost splendour and legacy!" 
 FU_Milan_Events.6.a: "Let us reclaim what once was ours!"
 FU_Milan_Events.6.b: "Let us stand firm with the times, instead."
 FU_Milan_Events.6.c: "The way forward is paved of the people - by the people!"
 FU_Milan_Events.7.t: "The Milano Ultimatum" 
 FU_Milan_Events.7.d: "News have arrived from the royal court of Milan. The head of state demands we immediately release our provinces on the bordering area of Tirol. According to the official letter the aforementioned lands will be put under Milanese protection as a sign of good faith and cooperation between the Austrian and Milanese crowns." 
 FU_Milan_Events.7.a: "We must accept." 
 FU_Milan_Events.7.b: "The musings of mice do not affect lions."
 FU_Milan_Events.8.t: "Pinacoteca e Biblioteca Ambrosiana" 
 FU_Milan_Events.8.d: "The Biblioteca Ambrosiana is a historic library in Milan, Italy, also housing the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana, the Ambrosian art gallery. Named after Ambrose, the patron saint of Milan, it was founded in 1609 by Cardinal Federico Borromeo, whose agents scoured Western Europe and even Greece and Syria for books and manuscripts. Some major acquisitions of complete libraries were the manuscripts of the Benedictine monastery of Bobbio (1606) and the library of the Paduan Vincenzo Pinelli, whose more than 800 manuscripts filled 70 cases when they were sent to Milan and included the famous Iliad, the Ilias Picta. \n\nDuring Cardinal Borromeo's sojourns in Rome, 1585–95 and 1597–1601, he envisioned developing this library in Milan as one open to scholars and that would serve as a bulwark of Catholic scholarship in the service of the Counter-Reformation against the treatises issuing from Protestant presses. To house the cardinal's 15,000 manuscripts and twice that many printed books, construction began in 1603 under designs and direction of Lelio Buzzi and Francesco Maria Richini. When its first reading room, the Sala Fredericiana, opened to the public on 8 December 1609 it was one of the earliest public libraries. One innovation was that its books were housed in cases ranged along the walls, rather than chained to reading tables, the latter a medieval practice seen still today in the Laurentian Library of Florence. A printing press was attached to the library, and a school for instruction in the classical languages." 
 FU_Milan_Events.8.a: "Come one, come all! Culture and knowledge for the masses!"
 FU_Milan_Events.10.t: "Milaner Wealth Display"
 FU_Milan_Events.10.d: "Milan's fashion history has evolved greatly throughout the years. Milan began as a centre of fashion in the Middle Ages and Renaissance, as in Venice and Florence, the making of luxury goods was an industry of such importance that in the 16th century the city gave its name to the English word "milaner" or "millaner", meaning fine wares like jewellery, cloth, hats and luxury apparel. By the 19th century, a later variant, "millinery", had come to mean one who made or sold hats. \n\nLater in the early 19th century cheaper silk began to be imported from Asia and the pest phylloxera damaged silk and wine production. More land was subsequently given over to industrialisation. Textile production was followed by metal and mechanical and furniture manufacture. In 1865, the first major department store in the country opened in Milan by the Bocconi brothers (which was called Alle Città d'Italia). This was regarded as a novelty at the time with regards to retailing in Italy. Though, traditionally, artisans would sell the items they made directly or to small stores, the opening of these new department stores modernised the distributions of clothes in the city."
 FU_Milan_Events.10.a: "One is never over-dressed or under-dressed with a little black dress."
 FU_Milan_Events.11.t: "The Milano Gazette" 
 FU_Milan_Events.11.d: "Milano was the first gazette published in the city of Milan. The first known number still in existence is dated 28 November 1640, but it is probable that the printing started some months before. As all the newspapers of such time, it derived directly from hand-writing newssheets. It is probable, but it is not verified, that the editor of the Milano was Filippo Velasca who during the 1640s was a compiler of handwritten Avvisi in Milan. \n\nSince 1640 the typographer was surely the Malatesta family who continued to publish it for all the life of the newspaper. The Malatestas were the official printer of the government in Duchy of Milan, having the monopoly of the official publications. They succeeded to pass this privilege for many generations, from Panfolfo (fl. 1594—1626) to Giulio Cesare (fl. 1635—1664), Giovanni Battista (fl. 1635—1654), Marc'Antonio Pandolfo (fl. 1664—1715) who in January 1672 started to print his name in the last page of the newspaper, and finally his nephew, Giuseppe Richini Malatesta (born in 1694 and died in 1793). Due to their privilege of publishing, the Malatestas were like the voice of the Government." 
 FU_Milan_Events.11.a: "Bah! Everyone else is fake news!"
 FU_Milan_Events.12.t: "Milano Conservatories and Opera Houses"
 FU_Milan_Events.12.d: "La Scala, an abbreviation in Italian of the official name Teatro alla Scala is an opera house in Milan, Italy. The theatre was inaugurated on 3 August 1778 and was originally known as the Nuovo Regio Ducale Teatro alla Scala (New Royal-Ducal Theatre alla Scala). The premiere performance was Antonio Salieri's Europa riconosciuta. \n\nMost of Italy's greatest operatic artists, and many of the finest singers from around the world, have appeared at La Scala. The theatre is regarded as one of the leading opera and ballet theatres in the world and is home to the La Scala Theatre Chorus, La Scala Theatre Ballet, La Scala Theatre Orchestra, and the Filarmonica della Scala orchestra. The theatre also has an associate school, known as the La Scala Theatre Academy (Italian: Accademia Teatro alla Scala), which offers professional training in music, dance, stage craft and stage management. \n\nDuring Mozart's first tour, his performances were well received, and his compositional talents recognised by commissions to write three operas for Milan's Teatro Regio Ducale, each of which was a critical and popular triumph. He met many of Italy's leading musicians, including the renowned theorist Giovanni Battista Martini, under whom he studied in Bologna.\n\nEvery level of our special §YComposer§! Advisor will also grant §G+0.5 Diplomatic Reputation§!" 
 FU_Milan_Events.12.a: "'The music is not in the notes, but in the silence between.'"
 FU_Milan_Events.13.t: "Santa Maria delle Grazie"
 FU_Milan_Events.13.d: "Originally ordered into construction by the famous Duke Ludoviko Sforza, the church was built upon an old gothic chapel and later became the official burial site of the entire Sforza dynasty. Adorned by a beautiful crossing and an exquisite dome, the church was designed by Donato Bramante. \n \nIn 1543, the Titian altarpiece depicting Christ receiving the crown of thorns was installed in the Chapel of the Holy Crown, located on the right of the nave. The painting, looted by French troops in 1797, it would later reside at the Louvre. This chapel is frescoed with Stories of the Passion by Gaudenzio Ferrari. In the small cloister adjacent to the tribune near the door that leads to the sacristy is a fresco by Bramantino. The church also contained frescoes depicting the Resurrection and Passion by Bernardo Zenale." 
 FU_Milan_Events.13.a: "What a magnificent display of faith!"
 FU_Milan_Events.14.t: "Santa Maria alla Fontana"
 FU_Milan_Events.14.d: "This beautiful declaration of piety is located just outside the city center and it is traditionally attributed to  Giovanni Antonio Amadeo, serving as both a gathering point for the believers and a sanctuary, a place of great healing. The oldest part is at the back and is made up of the shrine erected in 1507 by the will of the governor, Charles d'Amboise, who believed it to be miraculous and at that time attracted many sick andpilgrims. \nThis older part is characterized by a structure with massive pillars and arches on slender columns. Contrary to what has long been believed, the source of water in the premises of the church had little healing attributes and was merely exceptionally clean for its time, residing in an astonishing naturally-formed spring. A steep staircase connects this evocative original nucleus to the church above, built between 1547-1623." 
 FU_Milan_Events.14.a: "These waters befit royalty!"

 FU_Milan_Events.15.d: "The construction was begun by Gian Giacomo Dolcebuono and Giovanni Battagioin 1493, to house a miraculous icon of the Madonna, initially on the central plan. The first part to be built was the octagonal dome, covered externally by a tambour with a loggia and arcades decorated by twelve brickwork statues by Agostino De Fondulis, designed in Lombard style by Giovanni Antonio Amadeo.\nSome time later, the square portico in classical style was added, perhaps designed by Cesare Cesariano or Cristoforo Lombardo (il Lombardino). The massive eclectic and Mannerist style facade was designed by Galeazzo Alessi in the late 16th century and was realized by Martino Bassi. It is decorated by numerous statues and reliefs by Stoldo Lorenzi and Annibale Fontana. The interior houses numerous works by Milanese Renaissance and Baroque artists: Giovan Battista Crespi (il Cerano), Camillo and Giulio Cesare Procaccini, Carlo Francesco Nuvolone, Antonio Campi, Bergognone, Callisto Piazza and others. \nNotable are the Baptism of Jesus by Gaudenzio Ferrari and Giovan Battista della Cerva, the Fall of St. Paul by Moretto and, on the altar of the right transept, an altarpiece by Paris Bordone. The lectern of the choir is by Giuseppe Meda and on the left transept, within an altar designed by Martino Bassi, is the venerated marble statue of the Assunta by Annibale Fontana with two later angels by Giulio Cesare Procaccini.""

 tur_fund_madrasas_desc: "Our madrasas have become too small and few to deal with the number of great minds seeking knowledge within our realm. We need to fund new centers of learning and make them as accessible as possible in order to harness the full potential of our population." 
 tur_rebuild_hagia_sophia_title: "Rebuild the Hagia Sophia" 
 tur_rebuild_hagia_sophia_desc: "The Hagia Sophia was build by Justinian the Great and has long been the beating heart of the Greek Orthodox faith. It is a truly magnificent building and would a shame to demolish. We could leave it to our Orthodox subjects as a show of good faith or we could remake it in our image as a mosque worthy of the capital of a great Islamic nation." 
 tur_embellish_the_capital_title: "Embellish the Capital" 
 tur_embellish_the_capital_desc: "Ever since taking it for our capital Constantinople has been filled with the sound of construction. New palaces, public works and mosques have been started or completed almost every day. Inspired from the Byzantine architecture surrounding them our builders have developed an eclectic new style, marrying Byzantine and Islamic elements. We should build a great mosque in the new style to symbolize the unity of our subjects."
 tur_imperial_mosque_title: "Sultan Ahmed Camii" 
 tur_imperial_mosque_desc: "While we have built many mosques throughout the city of Constantinople, none can compete with the splendor of the grandest Orthodox churches. The time has come to build a grand mosque that shows our wealth and power for all to see." 
 tur_center_islamic_learning_title: "Scholarly Learning" 
 tur_center_islamic_learning_desc: "Even a mighty nation must not become complacent. Time and technology advances and the unaware will be left behind. We need to ensure adequate funding for our institutions of learning so that they can conduct their research. We must innovate ourselves rather than merely copy the discoveries of others." 
 tur_progress_tradition_title: "Progress & Tradition" 
 tur_progress_tradition_desc: "Ours is an old culture with many traditions and customs that go back centuries. Some of them have been shown to be hindering the efficient running of our nation. The time has come to consider if we want to maintain the status quo or abandon certain traditions in the name of progress. While the latter might upset the established elite, it might pay off in the long run."
 tur_kanuni_osmani_title: "Kanun-i Osmani" 
 tur_kanuni_osmani_desc: "Turkish law has not been codified, instead it has been passed orally and through tradition. This is antiquated and leads to diverging laws in different regions. The time has come to codify and standardize the laws to make them clear and easily understandable." 
 tur_blanket_scheme_title: "Enact the Blanket Scheme" 
 tur_blanket_scheme_desc: "While we have been fighting our enemies mostly with soldiers and cannons, this is not the only way to defeat our foes. Using economic warfare is often more expedient than marching armies across continents. Our economists have come up with a scheme to weaken the economy of our European foes. Maybe we should try it." 
 tur_new_soldier_title: "A New Soldier" 
 tur_new_soldier_desc: "The Janissaries have long been a core part of our military, acting as a counterbalance to the soldiers provided by the nobility. With their expansion and the taking of a new capital the time has come to create a new military academy for their training." 
 tur_found_acemi_oglan_title: "Found the Acemi Oglan" 
 tur_found_acemi_oglan_desc: "It seems we have underestimated our needs for Janissary recruits. As we have increasingly used Janissaries to fill civil service positions, both the number of recruits as well as the number of subjects taught the academy have increased. We need to increase the capacity of the academy as soon as possible." 
 tur_bektashi_order_title: "The Bektashi Order" 
 tur_bektashi_order_desc: "The Derwisches of the Bektashi Order have long held great influence in Anatolia. While these Sufi mystics have an eclectic understanding of the Quran, there power and influence would make them useful allies and annoying enemies. We should present ourselves as a benefactor in order to ensure their cooperation." 
 tur_harmonize_ottoman_laws_title: "Harmonize Jurisprudence" 
 tur_harmonize_ottoman_laws_desc: "In order to cause as little upset as possible to our non Islamic subjects we have generally let them keep their own laws, while our Muslim subjects follow the Sharia. With time and increasing integration of our society this system has become tedious and inefficient. The time has come to create a full set of laws that all our citizens have to follow regardless of faith. " 
 tur_marshal_ortas_title: "Marshal the Ortas" 
 tur_marshal_ortas_desc: "The Janissaries were started as a guard regiment and maintained the same organization since then. This is just no longer feasible for a large modern military force. We need to reorganize the different ortas." 
 tur_install_yerliyyas_title: "Install Yerliyyas" 
 tur_install_yerliyyas_desc: "As a mighty nation in a central location, we have borders with many hostile nations. These border regions are under constant threat from raiders and invaders. In order to ensure the safety of our citizens we should fortify them. " 
 tur_mansure_army_title: "The Mansure Army"
 tur_mansure_army_desc: "While the Jannisaries have been integral to the growth and governance of our empire, they have become antiquated and ineffective. Their officers are more interested in maintaining their privileges than serving the Sultan. Mayhaps the time has come to abolish the Janissary corps." 
 tur_address_firman_title: "Address a Firman"
 tur_address_firman_desc: "After the conquest of the Muslim states of the Iberian Peninsula the Muslims there have become increasingly oppressed by the Christian monarchs of the area. Many have been fleeing to surrounding Muslim nation. Many of these highly educated refugees could be of great use to us. The Sultan should consider releasing a Firman, granting these refugees the right to settle within our lands." 
 tur_cultivate_press_title: "Cultivate the Press" 
 tur_cultivate_press_desc: "As the printing press has been spread throughout our nation, books and pamphlets have been easier to produce and obtain than ever before. This could be used to serve the nations interest, but also to greatly harm the unity of the nation. The government needs to regulate this new industry and ensure that the releases do not hurt the peace of the nation."
 tur_tulip_period_title: "The Tulip Period"
 tur_tulip_period_desc: "With the increase in wealth and education our population has started clamoring for more power in government. This could mean a serious upset to the integrity of our nation. We need to carefully consider if and how many of their demands we will fulfill." 
 tur_tanzimat_revolution_title: "Tanzimat Revolution"
 tur_tanzimat_revolution_desc: "The Sultan has fallen, and the people have finally been given their long-silenced voice. Now we need to fortify our new position. Recently a charismatic leader has risen from the cauldron of the assembly. Maybe he will be able to lead us to a brighter future." 
 tur_finance_mercantile_class_title: "Finance the Sea Routes"
 tur_finance_mercantile_class_desc: "While trade can be highly lucrative it is also a risky venture. To spread the risk merchants have often sought to spread the risks by taking on investors. Offering them a percentage of the cargo for investing into the venture. It would be wise to use some of our coffers for such investments, not only to make money, but also to strengthen the economy and incentive mercantile activities. " 
 tur_piri_reis_title: "A Legend of Cartography" 
 tur_piri_reis_desc: "Our naval ambitions require accurate sea charts. Without them navigating our mighty fleet is next to impossible. With new lands discovered to the West and Europeans arriving in India this has become more important than ever." 
 tur_shores_india_title: "Shores of India" 
 tur_shores_india_desc: "The lands of India are rich and prosperous, but many Indian rulers place restriction on the flow of trade. We should try to create outposts on the Subcontinent, where trade can be conducted under our own more lenient laws. Otherwise this trade might go to our European rivals instead." 
 tur_marmaris_castle_title: "Marmaris Castle" 
 tur_marmaris_castle_desc: "The Aegean is of vital importance for our realm. Loosing control of it would greatly inhibit the movement of goods and soldiers between our European and Asian holdings. This must not be allowed. Be therefore propose the establishment of a naval garrison at Metesha. " 
 tur_pax_ottomana_title: "Pax Ottomana" 
 tur_pax_ottomana_desc: "We have finally succeeded. No nation since the Abbasid Caliphate has held such a far reaching influence upon this world. We are true successor of both Rome and the Caliphate. Let them see our might and despair." 
 tur_community_craftsmen_title: "Ehl-i Hiref Community" 
 tur_community_craftsmen_desc: "We are at the Crossroads of Europe, Asia and Africa. As such many merchants and goods pass through our lands and we are home to many wealthy merchants. We should thrive to be in good terms with these merchants."
 tur_attract_talented_artisans_title: "Attract Court Artisans" 
 tur_attract_talented_artisans_desc: "A nation cannot survive just by ferrying other nation´s produce from one nation to another. We need our own products to sell. As such we should encourage the creation of local artisan communities by lenient laws and incentives. Thereby we strengthen our own economy as well as creating jobs for our population." 
 tur_land_spice_title: "Land of Spice" 
 tur_land_spice_desc: "Besides Chinese silk and ceramics, the spice trade is the most lucrative trade passing through our lands. With the increasing wealth the European desire for spices has ever increased and with it their hunger for spice. We need to expand our trading ports in order to deal with the volume in spice flowing through them. The spice must flow." 
 tur_renovate_kaaba_title: "Renovate the Kaaba" 
 tur_renovate_kaaba_desc: "The Haddsch to the Kaaba is one of the pillars of our faith. Many a mighty ruler has undertaken it and lavished the city of Meccah with gifts. The time has come for our Sultan to undertake the Haddsch and show that we are truly the mightiest and wealthiest Muslim nation." 
 tur_industrial_education_title: "Industrial Education" 
 tur_industrial_education_desc: "While the manufacture of goods has long been based on workshops of artisans, this has been slowly changing. Large manufacturies with hundreds of employees are producing more goods more cheaply than 10 artisans ever could. We need to learn these new production techniques and start spreading them in our realm."
 tur_nouveau_literacy_title: "Nouveau Literacy" 
 tur_nouveau_literacy_desc: "The easier access to education has led to a spread of literacy, which in turn has given rise to a class of well-educated commoners serving our government. This has proven exceedingly successful for our nation. We should thrive to expand schooling to make it even easier for our citizens to get educated and become part of the growing class of intellectuals and entrepreneurs. " 
 tur_elevate_western_thought_title: "Study the Greek Thought" 
 tur_elevate_western_thought_desc: "While they were pagans the ancient Greeks have without question achieved great things. Even today their legacy looms large throughout our domain. We should emphasize this great legacy and that we are its successors through the Romans and Byzantines." 
 tur_subsidize_capital_expansion_title: "Subsidize Domestic Lines" 
 tur_subsidize_capital_expansion_desc: "Many of our more successful artisans are seeking investors in order to expand their operations. With more workers focusing on singular steps of production products will be produced faster and cheaper. We should invest in such manufactories." 
 tur_globalization_trade_title: "Vermeer's Hat" 
 tur_globalization_trade_desc: "With our central location we are in a prime location to become the center of global trade. A few more wise investments and we could become rich beyond our wildest imagination."

 #Events
 FU_Ottoman_Events.1.t: "Deposing the Knightly Scurge" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.1.d: "That the Knights of Saint John could even claim to be men of faith is a joke in and of itself. Perhaps in the days of Salah ad-Din, they may have been an honourable organization, even if still a heathen one. In recent years, however, the order has been nothing more than a gang of picaroons and reavers harassing our shipping lanes and seizing the goods of our peaceful merchants. Now that we’ve expelled this band of thieves from Rodos, however, our merchants can once again travel the seas unmolested, and denizens of our coastal settlements can sleep without fear of marauding Franks seizing their wealth. " 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.1.a: "Let our coasts be safe and prosper!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.2.t: "The High Court of Cyprus" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.2.d: "The final remnant of the Crusader States has, at last, succumbed to the sword of Islam. We have stormed the Island of Cyprus and seized the city of Nicosia from its King. The royal council, the Haute Cour, have come before us and offered their submission to our Sultan. The nobles of this council are glad to at last be free of the tyranny of their King and the overbearing influence of Italian merchants.Along with their submission, they have given us another offer; should our Sultan allow them to elect one of their own as Duke, they would aid us in ruling over the isle’s unruly Greek populace and commit their fleet to assist us in keeping order upon the seas." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.2.a: "They will serve the Sultan!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.2.b: "Eradicate the city and purge the unbelievers."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.2.c: "Let us not rush into this."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.3.t: "Victory for the House of $DYNASTY$"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.3.d: "It is beautiful; beautiful enough to bring tears to a man’s eye. Oh, I weep! I weep to see my Empire flourish so. My armies have brought all Anatolia to heel, petty Beys and the White Sheep alike brought to heel. Armenians, Kurds, and Pontic Greeks alike call me their Sultan. How the Almighty has blessed me, that I might rule lands so vast and great; that Osman Ghazi himself must look down unto me, knowing that his legacy is safe and secure in my hands. My heart flutters at the thought." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.3.a: "A day of celebration!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.4.t: "Classical Era of the Ottoman Empire"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.4.d: "My Padisah, the Classic Era of the Ottoman Empire is upon us! During this period a system of patrimonial rule based on the absolute authority of the sultan reached its apex, and the empire developed the institutional foundations which it would maintain, in modified form, for several centuries. The territory of our glorious and prestigious Empire will greatly expand, and lead to what some historians shall later called the Pax Ottomana, a few centuries later. The process of centralization undergone by the empire prior to 1453 was brought to completion in the reign of [Root.Monarch.GetName]." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.4.a: "An era of prosperity and expansion!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.5.t: "The Crusade of Varna"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.5.d: "Peace has again fallen over the Balkans with the defeat of the Christians at the Battle of Varna. Our Sultan’s dearest Father, Murad, answered his Son’s call to arms to defend us from these invaders. He has achieved a great victory, though at no small cost. Casualties at the battle were heavy on both sides, and our soldiers will need time to recover from the battering they have received. However, the Christians have come out of the fight in far worse a state, with Władysław III of Poland, Hungary, and Lithuania dead. Both Poland and Hungary find themselves in the chaos of an interregnum. Inshallah, their misfortunes will continue. Our victory has shaken Europe and Christendom to its very core, and all tremble before the might of the Sublime Ottoman State. None will dare lift a finger as we sweep our way through the Balkans. Serbia shall be ours. Wallachia will be ours. The Albanians will be brought to heel, and Skanderbeg will be killed like the dog he is. The greatest prize, also, will be ours; Constantinople." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.5.a: "The die is cast..."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.6.t: "Konstantiniyye, the Capital of the Empire"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.6.d: "Once it was the largest city in the world, but following its sacking at the hand of the Crusaders in the 13th century, the city of Constantine is a shadow of its former self. Following our capture of the city and subsequently making it the seat of our Empire; however, people from all across our lands have flocked to the city, swelling it to a size it hasn’t been in many centuries. Alongside resettling the city, this population influx has brought many men of talent; artisans, architects, and artists prime among them. With the skill of these men and the guiding hand of our Sultan, Konstantiniyye will once more be the pearl of the Mediterranean. " 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.6.a: "We are the continuation of Rome herself!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.7.t: "The Jews of Konstantiniyye"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.7.d: "Prior to our capture of Konstantiniyye from the Romans, many of the city’s Jews fled to rural Thrace or across the Bosporus to the Anatolian coast. Now that we have restored the city’s grandeur considerably, many of these Romaniote Jews have begun to flock back to the city, much to the chagrin of intolerant Christians and Muslims alike. Many of the city’s residents have called for us to prevent their return, though were we to offer them their old homes back and allow them to practice their beliefs in peace, no doubt Jews from elsewhere would begin to flock into the city, seeking the protection they are not afforded in Europe by the Christians, and bring their wealth and talents with them." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.7.a: "Allow their return."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.7.b: "We must serve our people, first."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.8.t: "Leading the Anatolian Ghazi Tribes" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.8.d: "It has now been many decades since Timur Gurkani’s rampaging through Anatolia and the subsequent civil war that erupted in our sublime state. Despite this, the cracks still show, as the petty Beys in Sinop and Karaman reign over subjects that are rightfully ours. We must rectify this situation immediately, both as a matter of pride and a matter of principle; it is unseemly that these petty despots continue to exist." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.8.a: "We will unite our brethren!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.9.t: "The Fate of the Holy City" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.9.d: "Jerusalem has been the battlefield upon which many heathens and believers have laid their lives bare in service of the divine cause of their faith. In between clashes, a significant amount of Christians makes its way to the holy sites of the City, paying respects to the various saints they look up to. As the city falls under our control, we must decide its fate, and with it, the fate of those who inhabit it regardless of religion." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.9.a: "It will become a centre of our religion once again!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.9.b: "All pilgrims must be welcome and protected by the mercy of Allah."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.10.t: "Grand Entrance in Fez!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.10.d: "The bells of the Great Mosque of Fez el-Jdid ring out into the city as Sultan [Root.Monarch.GetName] arrives in the city, himself and the entire Harem-i Humayun in palanquins atop elephants, five score of the grand beasts in all. Behind this, a cavalcade of standard-bearers on camelback thirty ranks deep. The entirety of the city’s population has come to bask in the magnificence of [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s procession. Following his entrance, [Root.Monarch.GetName] will be holding court in Fez for the coming weeks to ingratiate himself with his new Maghrebi subjects, with his current plan being to establish an autonomous Moroccan Pashalik due to how far-flung these territories are from Konstantiniyye. "
 FU_Ottoman_Events.10.a: "They will serve us as loyal subjects!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.10.b: "Our campaigns will take us further beyond."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.11.t: "Muslims Return in Iberia" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.11.d: "Truly, the greatness of our state continues only to reach higher and higher. Just as Tariq ibn Ziyad did centuries ago, the armies of our Sultan have crossed the Pillars of Hercules and driven the Spaniards north of the heartland of Al-Andalus, with the city of Qurtuba once again under the rule of pious Muslims. Not only do those Muslims left in Iberia rejoice at their liberation, the Sephardi Jews likewise celebrate a regime tolerant to their faith regaining control of these lands. We have achieved something that the world would have thought unthinkable even fifty years ago. "
 FU_Ottoman_Events.11.a: "Restore Al-Andalus, the rightful masters of Iberia!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.11.b: "The Iberians are next on the chopping block..."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.12.t: "Collapse of the Mamluk Sultanate" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.12.d: "To call the protection racket that the Mamluks have been running in Egypt and the Levant a state would be a generous assessment, to say the least. That their rule has lasted so long is a miracle to behold. Now, however, in our most recent round of conflict with them, the armies of our great Sultan have cut a swath of law and order through Syria and down into Egypt. Moreover, now that Kahire has fallen to our forces, the Mamluk administration has all but collapsed in their lands, and no real central government remains to oppose us in seizing the entirety of the Sultanate’s lands for ourselves. No doubt, however, our immediate seizure of all of these lands would require reliance on local powerbrokers, and the integration of the Sultanate’s lands into our administration would be a herculean feat."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.12.a: "Their lands belong to Sultan [Root.Monarch.GetName]!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.12.b: "Slow and steady wins the race..."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.13.t: "The Development of Trade in Egypt" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.13.d: "Now that Egypt has been under the guiding hands of truly magnanimous rulers that have sought to invest into the land rather than simply extract taxes and tariffs as the Mamluks were want to do, the lands of the Nile Delta have once again become a prosperous region bustling with Merchants from the world over. We stand to profit significantly from the trade passing through Egypt and up to Konstantiniyye. The obvious place to focus our investments is the Mediterranean coast of Egypt. However, an ambitious engineer has come to us with another plan for investment in Egypt’s trade…"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.13.a: "Concentrate our efforts in the coast."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.13.b: "I have a better idea..."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.14.t: "New Head of Ummah"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.14.d: "Ever since Murad Hudavendigar’s conquest of Edirne in 1362, our Sultans have formally claimed the title of Caliph, the leader of the Ummah. Now that we have firm control over Kahire, however, we have managed to summon the last Abbasid Caliph, Al-Mutawakkil III, to Konstantiniyye to formally surrender the title of Caliph to Sultan [Root.Monarch.GetName], giving him the sword and mantle of Muhammad. Not only is this a great position for our Sultan domestically, but it additionally affords him authority over all Muslims outside our borders, giving us greater opportunity to protect those unlucky enough to be ruled over by non-Muslims." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.14.a: "We are the defenders of our faith!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.15.t: "The Rise of Kilwa Masoko"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.15.d: "Ancient Azania! The lands of the Swahili, long hindered by grievance between petty city states, and trade federations, has been unified under the banner of the Empire..We welcome our brothers of the Sunni Faith under the just stewardship of the Illustrious [Root.Monarch.GetName] and with them an indispensable point of trade between us and the far East!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.15.a: "Glory and prosperity across the city!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.16.t: "Time Claims All" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.16.d: "It has been many years since the collapse of the Mamluk Sultanate and our subsequent takeover of their lands. While their central government collapsed, local rulers maintained authority and had to be afforded a significant amount of autonomy by our Sultans. However, time’s arrow forever moves, and as the years have worn on, the previously antagonistic Mamluk aristocrats have been firmly subsumed into our administration. While they remain a distinct class from other bureaucrats and landholders, their function in our administration is identical. Our ever-growing state apparatus has slowly eroded all but their most minor privileges and autonomy." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.16.a: "The end of an era..."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.17.t: "Commercial Ventures in the East!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.17.d: "My Padisah! Our endeavors in the East have paid off. It seems your earlier investments have been a wise expenditure.. Our merchants report that we are now among the greatest trading powers along the entire Silk Road." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.17.a: "Money makes the world go 'round!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.18.t: "Myrrh Imports for the Dhimmi" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.18.d: "Much to the joy of our Dhimmi, the fruitful lands of Aden have been bestowed by Allah with a bountiful harvest of Myrrh and other sought after herbs, further enriching our already prosperous trade routes between the East, and the European continent. Truly we are blessed!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.18.a: "We will bless them with great prosperity in the name of Allah the merciful!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.19.t: "Administrating the Horn" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.19.d: "Most illustrious Padisah, \nWith the Horn Of Africa, and the lands of the so called “Ethiopian Empire” coming under our command, we are faced with a predicament as to what to do about the sizable Coptic population..By all right of law they should bow to all merciful Allah, and renounce their ways lest they be put to the sword… However, they are an ancient and even, respectable people in their own right, although they are Kaffir, it may very well suit the needs of the empire to…. Shall we say? Indulge their beliefs, at least for the time being..after all it is inevitable that all will embrace the truth of  Islam, eventually…."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.19.a: "They will islamize or face annihilation!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.19.b: "We could learn from them, brother..."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.20.t: "The Three Court System of the Ottoman Empire"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.20.d: "As our caliphate expands and assimilates the people and cultures of its far most lands, we are faced with the question of how these non Muslim citizens of our sublime empire must be treated..  Although they do not embrace the truth of Islam and will never be held in as high esteem as our native citizenry.. we must adhere to the tenets set forth by Sharia and treat all fairly, as well as exercise just jurisprudence, lest we be no better than the barbaric Kings of Europe who prosecute our brethren with utmost prejudice. It is proposed that a judicial system of “ Three courts” be implemented to more justly address the affairs of non Muslims, and entities of economic interest." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.20.a: "The Sultanic law reigns supreme for all Ottoman subjects."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.21.t: "The Baghdad Eyalet" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.21.d: "Ancient capital of the Abbasid! Baghdad, city of law! City of the great Caliph Al-Mansur  has fallen  into the arms of the Ottoman empire, and the esteemed[Root.Monarch.GetName]  rightful and just heir to the Caliphate. Oh Noble Baghdad, long sufferer of injustice and indignity..after so many years of destitution and desecration;first at the hands of the depraved hordes of the far East, then the disgraceful Timurids, and lastly the dreadful mismanagement of the supposed “ Persian Empire”, at long last a proper steward for this most esteemed city!.. May Baghdad forever more be a shining beacon of Hanafi jurisprudence, and an inspiration to all who embody the Sunni Faith!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.21.a: "The beating heart of innovation and scholarly studies!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.22.t: "A City of Silk & Gold"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.22.d: "The Newly conquered Mazandaran lands of Tabarestan serve as a vital center of trade in our grand Empire ..With this port we have ensured that all regional trade must go through Ottoman customs as well as secured the flow of Silk and other riches from the kingdoms of the Far East, and with it, vast fortune….. Now what to do with all this gold?" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.22.a: "We must accomodate the incoming mercantile traffic from the East!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.22.b: "Order increased rewards for the soldiers, instead."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.23.t: "The Bay Toll of Hormuz" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.23.d: "With the assimilation of Hormuz into our glorious Empire, we have secured a vital choke point for trade to and from the Middle East, and Arabia…. It is true that our Caliphate grows by the day, and yet despite the profitable relationship we share with the far kingdoms, they pay us no direct tribute for the privilege.. is it not just for these non believer to pay Jizya?" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.23.a: "All your trade are belong to us!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.24.t: "Supremacy Over the Emerald Lion"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.24.d: "The Empire of Persia is vanquished and it’s vast holdings fallen under the righteous jurisprudence of our most Sublime Caliphate..Indeed, a mighty and formidable foe but even the Emerald Lion cannot stand between us and our penultimate destiny. Though much blood was shed and many a martyr born of this conquest.. the people of these lands are brothers in the faith, and deserving of respect..Indeed we shall rule justly and honor the history of this land by restoring “Persia” to its long lost glory as a valued member of our ever expanding Empire." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.24.a: "Their legacy and expertise shall serve [Root.Monarch.GetName]!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.25.t: "Weaving, Gold & Silk" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.25.d: "Long the favored adornment of nobility, from ancient times, from the glorious days of Rome! Silk.. No textile is more sought after, and no empire more rich in it than ours!...So much more than mere cloth, it is a testament to wealth and power, to influence, and reverence… an object of veneration and admiration of all, peasant and noble alike… What a blessing it is that we are so positioned to benefit from trade of this material..and what a testament to the divine destiny of our Empire and our people. Just as our silken robes envelop the bodies of the worlds monarchs and adorn their great halls ..so to will our sublime radiance envelop this world." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.25.a: "We weave the fabrics of life itself."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.26.t: "Reformation of the Sipahi"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.26.d: "Fierce as they are disciplined many an infidel fallen by their sword or bow….The Tatar are indeed a formidable and skilled fighting force…. We have before us an opportunity to enlist the services of these  warriors, and in doing so greatly expand the capability of our Sipahi.. Although no doubt a boon to our fighting forces, some fear the Janissary and nobility will take offense to such arrangements." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.26.a: "Bolster the Sipahi."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.26.b: "Let's not upset the Janissaries"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.27.t: "City of the Pilgrim King" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.27.d: "AstraKhan? No, Haji Tarkhan..Pilgrimage of kings… Capital of Khazzaria. First set to proper record by the esteemed Ibn Battuta on his journey from Iberia to the Holiest site of Mecca. A land that seems itself to cry out for better stewardship than that of the disparate tribes and so called “Khans” of the Golden Horde..We have thus far maintained a beneficial if not tenuous relationship with these tribesman, however after having stymied the ambition of the perfidious Russian Empire we can no longer in good faith entertain the notion that these war chiefs who have the audacity to refer to themselves as kings are of any comparison to our most illustrious Sultan, or indeed the notion that a loose confederation of disparate tribes is any match to an Empire...Under our stewardship and the watchful eye of [Root.Monarch.GetName] AstraKhan will flourish,and the jewel of the Caspian shall shine once more." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.27.a: "The shining pearl of the Caspian Sea!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.28.t: "Travelling the Asian Trade Routes"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.28.d: "Our expansion along the silk road has been a rather fruitful endeavor.. It was most wise of you Oh great Sultan, to invest heavily in our trade routes..  In addition to troves of silk and gold….our Merchants come back with not just wild tales, but all manner of strange animals, wondrous tapestries, fine wares crafted from bone and handfuls of translucent green stones said to be highly favored by the Eastern nobles..No doubt such imports can bolster the economy of our already prosperous nation. The merchants of Kirkkilise have expressed particular interest... "
 FU_Ottoman_Events.28.a: "Such interesting and fascinating goods."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.29.t: "Christians of the Caucasus"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.29.d: "Caucasia, the final and lone holdout of Orthodox Christianity amongst the lands of Prophet Muhammad….Long standing thorn in our side and impediment to Islamic unity, has finally been brought to heel by the might of the Ottoman Empire and the divine will of  [Root.Monarch.GetName], the magnificent… What to do with these souls? While it would be prudent, the militarists, and hardliners among us say, to simply crush this bastion of insolence and bring all who will not submit,under the sword.. .The more tolerant believe it possible that we can coexist, and even reap the benefits of a friendly relationship with the population..After all, they say..are we truly so different that we cannot strive towards the veneration of the divine together?  The choice, is yours..My sultan. Shall these lands be ruled by sword or by Script? Shall our path forward be forged in blood or in brotherhood? Either way, your word, is absolute." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.29.a: "Their bones will be the foundations of our greatness!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.29.b: "No matter how astray, we are all God's children..."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.30.t: "The Coptic Orthodox Church"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.30.d: "The Coptic Church and its followers have been inhabiting the Caucasia region for centuries. Wars and famines have ravaged the region as each aspiring conqueror threw their hats in a bid to reign in the people of these mountains. However, our masterful administration has shown that the peaceful way is indeed a better alternative. As a result, our subjects in the Caucasus have begun to experience tremendous prosperity, despite our differing views on religion!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.30.a: "They shall flourish under the banner of our great empire!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.31.t: "Employing the Grenzen"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.31.d: "The lands in our northern border are trifled with much instability, famine and constant threat of incursions. Thus, it's quite difficult for our local administrators to develop that land and attract new citizens. To counter this issue we have decided to provide citizenship to the natives of those lands. The inhabitants of these areas are known as the Grenzer, or frontiersmen. They are mostly Croatian, Serbian, German, Vlach and other colonists. In exchange for land-grants, religious freedom and favorable tax rates, they shall colonize the areas and served as the bulwark for the monarchy against enemy incursions."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.31.a: "They seem useful!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.32.t: "Sanjak of Albania" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.32.d: "Many instances in history are full of monarchs and despots cracking the whip on their helpless subjects. In many cases this is the ideal or only solution. However, a good Sultan knows when to use the carrot and the stick. The local nobles of Albania have been reigned in effectively but who's to say they won't rise up again? Many differing opinions in the palace suggest we should ideally purge them, instead of allowing them to carry on with their local duties." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.32.a: "Sticks and stones may break their bones..." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.32.b: "...but chains and whips excite me!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.33.t: "Eyalets of Hungary" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.33.d: "The Carpathian border is one full of instability and rebellions. The local Hungarians still yet remember the bitter defeats their former Kingdom suffered at the hands of our Sultan. As a result, they are quite uncooperative with the current administration. Would it be wise to perhaps delegate the local administration to a semi-autonomous puppet of the former Hungarian nobility ?" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.33.a: "Delegate all the administration to one Eyalet."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.33.b: "The land belongs to the crown!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.33.c: "A Hungarian's life for me!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.34.t: "Integration of the Serbian and Wallachian Lands" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.34.d: "The introduction of new Christian lands has fostered more questions about the religious making of our Empire, as most of our Islamic subjects find themselves at home in Anatolia, rather than the Balkans. Despite cautious voices of the raising influence of the Janissaries, we can't help but delight at the sight of all these young Christian boys recruits, eager to join the ranks and serve the Empire!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.34.a: "They will flock to our standard!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.35.t: "The Crown of Rome" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.35.d: "One of the most contentious titles in the entire world's history, Rome was said to end with the fall of Constantinople in the first half of the 15th Century. Despite all the neigh-sayers who once denied us this title, we have accumulated the lands of the former Roman Empire under our grandeur and control. We can thus declare with a passion that the golden era of empires still bodes strong and rightfully, the title lies with our Sultan [Root.Monarch.GetName]!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.35.a: "We are the continuation of the world's greatest Empire!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.36.t: "Capital of the Western World" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.36.d: "The most illustrious, the most beautiful city of Rome now lies within our grasp! Celebrations burst across our many courts as our subjects, viziers and nobles raise a glass in honour of conquering the very heart of Catholicism, the shining emblem of the white city! Henceforth we shall be the masters of all and may now bid for the crown of Rome..." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.36.a: "Their lineage is now our own!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.37.t: "The Collection of Byzantine Law" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.37.d: "Proper management of our lands is the basis upon which we will build an empire that will stand the test of time. To do so, Sultan [Root.Monarch.GetName] collected all of the best Byzantine laws, with attention to detail and ample consideration for the Sharia, and added them into one single tome of learning and judicial understanding." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.37.a: "Knowledge begets knowledge..."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.38.t: "Millet System" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.38.d: "The newly conceived Millet System is a part of the Ottoman administration of separate religious communities that acknowledged each community’s authority in overseeing its own communal affairs, primarily through independent religious court systems and schools. This approach will assist us in holding a firm grasp on non-Muslim territories in the Balkans and beyond." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.38.a: "These communities are part of our great Empire."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.39.t: "Centralizing the Empire of Osman" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.39.d: "It is often too easy to sit back and enjoy the fruits of victory, as they tumble quickly into our mouths. However, as we tend to matters of wars with the eye of a hawk, matters of administration and internal affairs must not elude our perception, a healthy state of affairs is a healthy nation, after all. As we strive to attain centralization, most nobles and various factions at court insist that we need not press the steaming engine of centralization forward and instead let it come naturally, focusing instead of appeasing the estates themselves." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.39.a: "The future awaits!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.39.b: "Let's not rush to change the status quo..."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.40.t: "Solidifying the Ottoman Legal Code" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.40.d: "At the helm of an expanding empire, [Root.Monarch.GetName] personally instituted major judicial changes relating to society, education, taxation and criminal law. His reforms, carried out in conjunction with the empire's chief judicial official Ebussuud Efendi, harmonized the relationship between the two forms of Ottoman law, sultanic, commonly known as Kanun and religious, known as Sharia. After eliminating duplications and choosing between contradictory statements, he issued a single legal code, all the while being careful not to violate the basic laws of Islam. It was within this framework that  [Root.Monarch.GetName], supported by his Grand Mufti Ebussuud, sought to reform the legislation to adapt to a rapidly changing Empire. When the Kanun laws attained their final form, the code of laws became known as the Kanun-i Osmani, or the 'Ottoman laws'.  [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s legal code was to last more than three hundred years." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.40.a: "Expand the powers of the Parliament!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.40.b: "Delegate important duties to capable administrators!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.40.c: "Concentrate absolute power in the hands of the Sultan!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.41.t: "The Mansure Reforms" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.41.d: "Centuries of infighting and corruption have led to the Janissaries experiencing decadence, content with increased influence and meddling in the Sultanic affairs, they have become brazen and forgot who their allegiance lies with. Our recent attempts to reform the army and improve the current situation has not gone unnoticed, sadly. Janissary officers have gathered behind some of our generals, demanding we not only cease the reforms but to also abdicate the throne to their form of government with a puppet in the Ottoman Throne. Should we not comply, they intimidate that the entire country will be destabilized and they will take up arms to defend their centuries-old rights!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.41.a: "We must reform at any cost!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.41.b: "Bow down to Janissary influence."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.42.t: "Moriscos Arrive from Granada" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.42.d: "Sultan [Root.Monarch.GetName] sent out proclamations throughout the empire that the refugees were to be welcomed. He granted them the permission to settle in the Ottoman Empire and become Ottoman citizens. He ridiculed the conduct of the monarchs of Castile and Aragon in expelling a class of people so useful to their subjects. 'You venture to call Ferdinand a wise ruler,' he said to his courtiers — 'he who has impoverished his own country and enriched mine!' [Root.Monarch.GetName] addressed a firman to all the governors of his European provinces, ordering them not only to refrain from repelling the Spanish refugees, but to give them a friendly and welcome reception. He threatened with death all those who treated the Moriscos harshly or refused them admission into the empire." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.42.a: "They are most welcome." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.42.b: "We cannot risk angering the Iberian monarchs."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.43.t: "The Art of Cartography of Piri Reis"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.43.d: "Piri began engaging in government-supported privateering, a common practice in the Mediterranean Sea among both the Muslim and Christian states of the 15th and 16th centuries, when he was young, following his uncle Kemal Reis, a well-known corsair and seafarer of the time, who later became a famous admiral of the Ottoman Navy. During this period, together with his uncle, he took part in many naval wars of the Ottoman Empire against Spain, the Republic of Genoa and the Republic of Venice, including the First Battle of Lepanto in 1499 and the Second Battle of Lepanto (Battle of Modon) in 1500. When his uncle Kemal Reis died in 1511, his ship was wrecked by a storm in the Mediterranean Sea, while he was heading to Egypt, Piri returned to Gelibolu, where he started working on his studies about navigation.  \n\nIn 1547, Piri had risen to the rank of Reis, commonly known as admiral, as the Commander of the Ottoman Fleet in the Indian Ocean and Admiral of the Fleet in Egypt, headquartered in Suez. During that time, he authored of the Kitab-i Bahriye, or Book of the Sea, one of the most famous cartographical works of the period. The book gives seafarers information on the Mediterranean coast, islands, crossings, straits, and gulfs as well as where to take refuge in the event of a storm, how to approach the ports, and precise routes to the ports. The work was first published in 1521, and it was revised in 1524-1525 with additional information and better-crafted charts in order to be presented as a gift to Sultan Suleiman I. The revised edition had a total of 434 pages containing 290 maps." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.43.a: "We must employ him!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.51.t: "Rebellions in the Balkans" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.51.d: "The Janissary rebels seem to be gathering en masse across our Balkan territories. Like hungry wolves they take up arms against the Sultan in a vile attempt to usurp the crown that was so rightfully given to him by God Himself!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.51.a: "Get me my whip!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.52.t: "Rebellions in the Anatolian Territories"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.52.d: "The Janissary rebels seem to be gathering en masse across our Anatolian territories. Like hungry wolves they take up arms against the Sultan in a vile attempt to usurp the crown that was so rightfully given to him by God Himself!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.52.a: "By Allah they shall have a taste of my boot!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.53.t: "Janissary Defections" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.53.d: "My Sultan! It appears that many soldiers in our grand army have decided to defect and travel our lands to either escape the impending mayhem or join the rebel scum! We must separate the wheat from the chaff but it appears that doing so has left our army wholly unprepared for the oncoming troubles. A black day for our history books!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.53.a: "Bah, we will make a new army! With cannons and rifles!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.53.b: "We have to secure the remaining army's loyalty." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.54.t: "End of the Janissary Rebellions" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.54.d: "We have weathered the storm! After years of brutal combat across the entirety of our Empire, the Janissary rebels have been thoroughly massacred! It is no secret that none of them will rebel, if those who wanted to have been experly wiped out. This moment was dreamt by our predecessors for centuries, yearning to rid the country of the Janissaries' influence. We can now re-militarize our nation and westernize our troops!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.54.a: "Finally, a clear sky!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.55.t: "Rocket Man" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.55.d: "O my sultan! Be blessed, I am going to talk to Jesus! Those are the words that Legari Hasan Celebi spoke to [Root.Monarch.GetName] as he was about to take off in what seemed to be a quirky and weird mechanical contraption full of chemicals and gunpowder. Who's to say these days with all these new trends that our people engage in. So long as he's wearing protective kneepads!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.55.a: "Ground control to Major Celebi!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.55.b: "Away with you, vile beggar!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.56.t: "The Guns of Urban" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.56.d: " One of the most influential siege specialists of the 15th century, Urban initially offered his services to the Byzantine Emperor. However, due to lack of imperial funds for his salary, they were thankfully unable to keep him in the court. As a sign of spite, he has made an astute appearence in our stairs, asking to be employed and promising that his siege machines will bring the strongest walls down in a dramatic fashion."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.56.a: "Surely employing him is a balanced decision!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.57.t: "Janissaries Demand Privileges" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.57.d: "Disgruntled Janissaries have made their way to the Sultan's private chamber. With their hands on their swords they demand their fair share of royal privileges, just like the other Estates enjoy theirs. According to their written declaration it is inconcievable that the Sultan's most decorated armed forces are made to feel lesser to petty nobles and merchants!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.57.a: "We must accept..."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.57.b: "Never!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.58.t: "Surgun Flock to [151.GetName]" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.58.d: "With our grand campaign in the Balkans commencing with the conquest of Constantinople, we have begun to see a surge in migration from nearby towns and villages into the city. These people, called the Surgun have moved to Constantinople to uplift their standard of living and livelihoods. Not only would this result in increased standard of living and income for the migrants, the grand city itself would benefit from the extra workforce and labour. May the Almighty bless us with such days of prosperity constantly!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.58.a: "They are most welcome!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.59.t: "Dhimmi Religions Thrive in [151.GetName]" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.59.d: "The immense development project in Constantinople has at last, begun to bear fruit. Over the years, many religious minorities like the Jews, among many others have migrated to the City of the World's Desire. These minorities have set up their own communities within the city and have begun to intermingle with other religious communities. Many of these communities have begun to thrive within Constantinople, earning enough to sustain themselves and their families. Rarely has any other nation shown as much tolerance for other religions as compared to us, and that is the reason why the city of Constantinople is going through its mini–Golden Era." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.59.a: "All shall prosper under our banner!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.60.t: "Qizilbash Rebellions" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.60.d: "The Qizilbash were Turkoman-Sh'ia militant groups that flourished immensely in the eastern part of the Anatolian Peninsula during the late 15th century. These figures played an important role in the consolidation of Persia by the Safavids. In 1512, the Safavids began with their da'wah within the Ottoman Empire and the conversion of Eastern Turkoman Tribes, who ended up joining the Safavid Ranks. As a result of this, the Shi'ite Turks living in Asia Minor were beginning to get deported into the region of Morea. The Safavid Qizilbash made their way into Kurdistan, defeating the local Turkish Garrisons while being heavily outnumbered. Now, the Ottoman Empire is treading a cross-road, between complete defeat and humiliation and ultimate and everlasting victory!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.60.a: "Grand Vizier, get my whip!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.61.t: "Sahkulu Rebellions" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.61.d: "The 1510s were turbulent times within the Ottoman Empire. Safavid Missionaries and Qizilbash Militants ran rampant in the eastern parts of the Empire. In 1511, the Turkoman Qizilbash rallied under the cause of Shahkulu, the son of the halife of Teke. He has been a thorn in our sides for a long time, and he dared to raid our grand caravans in the east. Our Empire has no place for such rabid and vile creatures, let us now raise the banner of the prophet and crush these animals once and for all." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.61.a: "Damn these Shiites!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.62.t: "The Tomb of Abu Hanifa" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.62.d: "Imam Abu Hanifa was a Sunni Muslim Theologian and jurist born in Greater Khorasan, Persia. Widely credited as the founder of the Hanifa School of thought, his body was forever cherished in a mosque in Baghdad. Now, with our recent conquest of the grand city, it is up to the decision of the Sultan whether to restore the Tomb of Hanifa or to save the ducats so that they could be allocated elsewhere." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.62.a: "Restore his tomb and honor his legacy!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.62.b: "Our coin is best spent elsewhere!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.63.t: "Poor Economic Policies of [Root.Monarch.GetName]" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.63.d: "It seems as though the poor economic policies of the Sultan have shown their ugly colors. The Ottoman economy has collapsed overnight. The collapse has resulted in hyperinflation and more general unrest across the borders of the empire. It will take many months before we could recover from this tragedy." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.63.a: "Mint EVERYTHING!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.64.t: "The Siyer-i Nebi"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.64.d: "Completed in 1338 by the Mustafa of Erzurum, Al Darir on the demand of Sultan Berkuk, it is an epic depicting the journey of the Prophet Muhammand. Murad III had ordered the complete visual depiction of the epic, and was undertaken by the calligrapher Lufti Abdullah. This record was described as "the largest single cycle of religious painting in Islamic art" by contemporaries. It consists of 814 miniatures which are expertly depicted. It is very different than compared to other Islamic Caricatures and remains a prideful possession of the Sultan. Forever shall glory hail on the Ottoman Empire!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.64.a: "A celebrated literature for the Great Prophet!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.65.t: "Islamic Epistemology in [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s Era"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.65.d: "Epistemology. The word itself is as mystic as the meaning behind it. The theory of knowledge on anything is referred to as its epistemology. With our Sultan favoring more and more Islamic Philosophers, they have been focusing more and more on understanding the philosophy behind Islam. This will surely lead to everlasting glory for the Ulema of the Ottomans due to the never-ending patronage of the Sultan!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.65.a: "An era of learning and philosophy!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.66.t: "Suleiman the Magnificent"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.66.d: "Born as the son of Sultan Selim I and Hafsa Sultan, a Muslim convert, Suleiman has shown such exceptional talent that was rarely seen in Ottoman Sultans at the time. He was a well learned man, and was taught Islamic Literature from a very young age. He also took interests in subjects that most young men would be repulsed from like science, history, literature and military tactics. If he is designated as the heir to the Empire, many are sure that the Empire would achieve its greatest."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.66.a: "The crown of the prince is his!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.66.b: "No cutting in line, little Suleiman!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.67.t: "Janissaries Demand Reinstation of Privileges" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.67.d: "After our recent feud with the janissaries, many of the Janissaries have grown discontent with the Sultan’s policies. They demand the reinstation of privileges that have been snatched away from them and they also demand greater autonomy. Whilst this will please the Janissaries, it may lead to the Sultan’s reputation getting tarnished and being called a coward. On the other hand, if we refuse these privileges to the Janissaries, it may deepen their discontentment further, and may lead to an open rebellion. We must consider all options, and decide our next step carefully. " 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.67.a: "So be it." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.67.b: "Talk to the hand."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.68.t: "Safeguarding the Line of Succession" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.68.d: "Our Current Vali Ahad is the one who we deem the most appropriate to rule our Empire. He however, has many brothers. These Brothers envy his position as the heir and also hold positions of authority within the Empire. These incompetent fools may try to rise up when our Vali Ahad takes the throne and try to disrupt his rule. Therefore, it is best that we get rid off these jackals while we have our time. However, doing this may have some unforeseen consequences in the future. We shall consider this choice carefully."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.68.a: "We only need ONE Vali Ahad!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.68.b: "Let us not risk an open rebellion..."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.68.c: "Blood is thicker than water, brother." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.69.t: "A Heart Once Broken" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.69.d: "Oh, how innocent was his smile. How he reached me with questions regarding the Empire. “Father!” he would say. “Father, how large is the Holy Land?” He asked me once. I remembered laughing with him as we swallowed fruits. I thought… that what I did for him was for the better. Apparently, I was wrong. Hearing the news of his brothers’ untimely demise, my healthy, steadfast prince fell ill, very ill and now, he lays in an eternal slumber… right in front of me. I want to see his face for the last time, but I can’t. Forever, will the guilt engulf me. In my sleep, I will remember the faces of my other sons whom I mercilessly murdered, and I can no longer face my wife or my concubines. All that exists now, is guilt and shame." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.69.a: "My boy, my poor boy..." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.70.t: "A Letter from the Queen-Mother"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.70.d: "“My Sultan and Son” the letter said. “It has been quite some time since I last saw you. I know that you live a busy life in Constantinople now.” It continued. “It would be my greatest pleasure, as a mother, if you could come and spend some time with me.” Tears fill my eyes, how long it has been since I last saw her. “I have gone through painstakingly long nine months before I gave birth to my pride. I know that it’s quite sudden. But it would be quite the joyful experience if I could spend time with you again.” I put the letter down and ponder. I miss her and really want to see her, but is leaving the duties of the Sultan justified for meeting family?"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.70.a: "I have missed you, mother."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.70.b: "The affairs of state wait for no man!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.71.t: "Kira and Strongilah" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.71.d: "Strongilah is unlike any women seen in the Harem. She was a daughter of a Karaite Jew from Crimea. She was the first Kira in Harem and acted as a go-between for luxury goods as well as medicines. She eventually consolidated a lot of power in the Harem of Selim I and became the favorite of Hafsa Sultan. She was eventually allowed to own slaves and was exempted from paying taxes as per the request of Hafsa Sultan. Some members of the Harem and administration despise the extra power she has been given and demands reduction of her power. Who shall the Sultan favor in this case?" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.71.a: "She will serve us finely." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.71.b: "The estate does not need the input of a harem member."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.72.t: "Family First"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.72.d: "Today, I met with my mother. Has she really gotten this old since I last saw her? It was my duty, as a son, above that of a Sultan to meet her, and to spend time with her. The time spent with her felt like two seconds, even though it was two hours for the courtiers. It was quite refreshing, walking down the floors of the palace along with her by my side. I shared stories from my side, and she shared stories from hers, many of which seemed to amuse me. Perhaps, If I weren’t the Sultan, I would have spent my days like this, but oh well, I can ponder about that some other time" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.72.a: "It's good to see you, mother!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.73.t: "Reign of Women" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.73.d: "During the Seljuk Reign over Anatolia, the female nobility held immense power in matters of policies and affairs. This however, began to decline with the emergence of the ‘lead from the horse’ doctrine. Earlier Ottoman policies included granting governorships to princes and their mothers, due to which they would not be able to challenge the true heir. All of this changed with the turn of the 16th century. This saw the reign of Sultan Suleiman I, and with that reign came several changes, one of which was the integration of the Imperial Harem into the palace. These changes made the mothers and wives of the Sultan have almost unlimited power in the matters of administration and diplomacy. This ‘Sultanate of Women’ led to immense growth of public works, facilities and defense. This reign saw immense criticism from men within the Empire, like viziers and advisors. Thus, a question arose. Is giving immense power to the women within the harem worth it?" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.73.a: "They shall be the right hand of the Sultan!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.73.b: "We cannot divide royal power."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.74.t: "Testing the Limits of Royal Power" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.74.d: "It seems as though the ‘Sultanate of Women’ policy has come to bite us in the back. The Legal Mother of the Sultan has been testing the limits of royal power that had been generously given to them by the Sultan. These foolish women of the Sultanate have been meddling with royal affairs as well, which we simply could not let slide. However, the Sultan still favors her mother, citing that it is her legal right, as the mother of the Sultan to advise him on matters of legislation and administration. What should be done concerning the power of the Women?"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.74.a: "It is well within her right!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.74.b: "Her excesses need to be curbed."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.75.t: "Hayreddin Barbarossa"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.75.d: "Also known as Hizir Hayrettin Pasha, and simply Hizir Reis, was an Ottoman corsair and later admiral of the Ottoman Navy. Barbarossa's naval victories secured Ottoman dominance over the Mediterranean during the mid 16th century. Born on Lesbos, Khizr began his naval career as a corsair under his elder brother Oruç Reis. In 1516, the brothers captured Algiers from Spain, with Oruç declaring himself as Sultan. Following Oruç's death in 1518, Khizr inherited his brother's nickname, Barbarossa, Redbeard in Italian. He also received the honorary name Hayreddin. In 1529, Barbarossa retook the Penon of Algiers from the Spaniards. In 1533, Barbarossa was appointed Kapudan Pasha (Grand admiral) of the Ottoman Navy by Suleiman the Magnificent. He led an embassy to France in the same year, conquered Tunis in 1534, achieved a decisive victory over the Holy League at Preveza in 1538, and conducted joint campaigns with the French in the 1540s. Barbarossa retired to Constantinople in 1545 and died the following year. Such a resourceful admiral will surely serve us well!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.75.a: "He will make a fine admiral!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.77.t: "This is Literally 1984 I can't believe you did this"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.77.d: "the developer of this mod is a complete child, i was banned from the discord server because he didnt like the way i type, sure the mod is good but the person who develops it acts like a complete child. im gonna have to not play it due to that, i dont want to support someone who bans people who have been playing their mod since the begining for not liking the way they type."

 per_a_sons_revenge_title: "A Son's Revenge"
 per_a_sons_revenge_desc: "Our shaikh has been martyred at the hands of the accursed Shirvanshah. Qizilbash - to arms! We must avenge the son of our dynasty and raise a magnificent khanqah over the smoldering ruins of Baku if we are to conquer the Caucasus and unify Iran." 
 per_subjugate_the_caucasus_kingdoms_title: "Subjugate the Caucasus"
 per_subjugate_the_caucasus_kingdoms_desc: "Now that Ottoman ambitions threaten our rule over the Caucasus, the time has come to protect the Georgians. Doing so would secure a valuable source of soldiers, bureaucrats, and noble daughters should we choose to embrace them, and as the qizilbash become increasingly powerful, they may prove to be a valuable counterweight to their zealous excess." 
 per_cross_the_mountains_title: "Cross the Mountains"
 per_cross_the_mountains_desc: "Beyond the Caucasus lie the mountains of Dagestan, the forests of Circassia, and the steppes of the Taman Peninsula. The people of this land are fierce fighters who would make excellent additions to the ranks of the qizilbash. Furthermore, while the sons of our esteemed dynasty have traditionally been born of Turkmen mothers, the noble daughters of the Circassian tribes would do well to marry into our house."
 per_gateway_india_title: "Gateway to India"
 per_gateway_india_desc: "The unruly Pashtun and Baloch tribes of eastern Khorasan have been a continual thorn in our side since the founding of our dynasty. Securing their cooperation presents the opportunity to take advantage of their important role in northeast Hindustan's military labor market to cross the Khyber Pass toward the rich plains of Punjab."
 per_hindus_river_title: "The Indus River" 
 per_hindus_river_desc: "The mighty Indus flows through the great cities of Sindh and Punjab. This is a land of thriving cities, bustling markets, fertile farmlands, and hundreds of Sufi saints, holy men, and religious orders. Bringing it under our rule will let these orders blossom under our protection as we harness the region's incredible wealth." 
 per_break_bhadra_fort_title: "Break the Bhadra Fort"
 per_break_bhadra_fort_desc: "To the east of Sindh lie the cosmopolitan ports of the Gujarat Sultanate. While the Muzaffarids have effectively reaped the rewards of the fabulous wealth flowing through the cities of Surat, Khambhat, and Ahmedabad, the recent assassination of their sultan has left their land ripe for the taking. Let us strike while the iron is hot, scale the Bhadra Fort, and defeat the Gujaratis once and for all!" 
 per_gurjarabhumi_title: "Unite Western India"
 per_gurjarabhumi_desc: "The fractured states of Gujarat, Rajputana, and the Malwa Plateau stubbornly resist our rule. We must bring them into the fold so that they may prosper under our benevolent stewardship." 
 per_master_of_india_title: "Master of India" 
 per_master_of_india_desc: "In the name of God, most gracious, most merciful, our esteemed dynasty has done what the Timurid, Sayyid, Lodi, and Sur dynasties failed to do and become the undisputed masters of Hindustan! The lion and sun flies over Delhi and prayers are said in the name of our shah in mosques across the land. We alone have conquered the unconquerable. While the question of how our state will integrate itself into Hindustan's cultural fabric remains, it is clear that we will go down in history as one of its greatest empires."
 per_sponsor_madrasas_title: "Sponsor Madrasas" 
 per_sponsor_madrasas_desc: "Madrasas are educational institutions in which students learn math, science, theology, ethics, and metaphysics. Madrasas include living quarters, lecture rooms, and a prayer hall laid out along a conventional four-iwan courtyard plan. Continuing the Timurids' support of these distinguished religious institutions will grant our state a steady supply of highly educated clerics, bureaucrats, and administrators." 
 per_the_persian_administration_title: "Persian Administration"
 per_the_persian_administration_desc: "The effectiveness of our state is marred by constant power struggles between the Turkmen qizilbash who form the core of our army and the Persian notables who fill the ranks of our bureaucracy and religious establishment. As the qizilbash become ever bolder in their efforts to subvert our authority, we must embolden the Persians by appointing one of their own as the Shah's wakil (viceregent) in religious and administrative affairs." 
 per_reform_first_pillar_title: "Reform the First Pillar" 
 per_reform_first_pillar_desc: "Our shah is under the protection of the qurchi bodyguard corps. Led by the powerful qurchi-bashi, the qurchis are recruited from the principal qizilbash tribes and are paid by the royal treasury. Despite their origins among the qizilbash, their personal loyalty to our dynasty distinguishes them from the tribes and empowering them by swelling their ranks and appointing their most capable commanders as governors and bureaucrats may tighten our grip on the state at the expense of the qizilbash." 
 per_gunpowder_empire_title: "Gunpowder Empire" 
 per_gunpowder_empire_desc: "The increasing importance of gunpowder weapons in warfare has prompted our shah to establish the tofangchi musket and tupchi artillery corps. Equipped with modern weapons, these soldiers have successfully adapted the use of firearms to the swift and flexible maneuvering typical of traditional Iranian tactics. The invention of the zamburak, a mobile swivel gun mounted on the backs of camels, has further eased the integration of firearms into an army suited to fighting in the steep mountain passes of the Zagros." 
 per_commemorate_arbadeen_title: "Commemorate Arba'een"
 per_commemorate_arbadeen_desc: "Arba’een commemorates the end of the forty-day mourning period after Ashura, the day on which the venerable Hazrat Husayn, son of Hazrat Ali and grandson of the Prophet Muhammad was tragically martyred at Karbala. As we honor his martyrdom, we must remember the words of the Sixth Imam in our commitment to liberate the masses from the yoke of ignorance. Let us harness the popular piety of the people by building mosques, renovating shrines, performing pilgrimages, and reaffirming our role as the Twelfth Imam’s sole representative on earth during the Major Occultation." 
 per_enlarge_blue_mosque_title: "Embellish the Blue Mosque"
 per_enlarge_blue_mosque_desc: "The great Turkmen padishah Shah Jahan Qara Qoyunlu graced the imperial city of Tabriz with a magnificent mosque whose expansive dome and elegant solution to the ever-present structural problem of reconciling light and space is sure to inspire generations of future architects. Let us honor this masterpiece by embellishing it with the artistic expertise of our own dynasty."
 per_heavenly_devotion_title: "Heavenly Devotion" 
 per_heavenly_devotion_desc: "Our dynasty has risen from a small Sufi order in the mountains of Azerbaijan to the primary protectors of the Muslim world. While we have traditionally encouraged manifestations of popular piety such as tasawwuf, saint veneration, shrine worship, pilgrimage, and devotion to Hazrat Ali and the ahl al-bayt, the immense spiritual authority we have accrued has granted us the golden opportunity to decide the direction in which we will steer the religious affairs of our state." 
 per_rekindle_the_flames_title: "To Rekindle the Flames"
 per_rekindle_the_flames_desc: "Our great land was once lit with the flickering flames of the holy fires that graced the temples of our ancestors. Burning ever so bright with its brilliant purity, fire reminds us of the glory of Hormazd and the sacred truth revealed by the Prophet Zartosht so many centuries ago. Let us cherish the holy fires that survive and inaugurate a new era for our faith by building magnificent temples across Iran!" 
 per_restore_mobeds_title: "Restore the Mobeds"
 per_restore_mobeds_desc: "The time has come to enlist the aid of our Parsi brothers in Hindustan in rebuilding the priestly mobed class that attends to our holy fires. We will need to teach our priests to preserve the Avesta, organize our religious festivals, purify the dadgah and adaran fires during Adar Mah, and perform the Yasna ceremony vital to the defense of Hormazd in his cosmic struggle against chaos and destruction." 
 per_path_to_kingship_title: "Path to Kingship" 
 per_path_to_kingship_desc: "Temples have been built, rites have been performed, mobeds have been trained, and we have diligently followed our directives to find common cause with our Muslim subjects to lead them down the path of enlightenment. Our fostering of a new religious synthesis has led to the rise of various syncretic sects that have fused our respective religious traditions, guiding the ignorant toward the one true faith. We have cemented our place as the rightful rulers of Iran, heralding a new age for our resurgent faith." 
 per_conquer_armenian_cities_title: "Secure Armenia"
 per_conquer_armenian_cities_desc: "The Armenians are a proud but divided people, and exploiting these divisions to bring them under our rule would secure the eastern Caucasus. While ripe for conversion, the Christians are skilled merchants, and supporting their communities may yield its own rewards..."
 per_crush_house_osman_title: "Crush the Turks" 
 per_crush_house_osman_desc: "Our practice of recruiting the Shi'a Turkmen of eastern Anatolia to raid Ottoman holdings has provoked Sultan Selim to authorize the massacre of thousands of Shi'a Alevis and qizilbash across Anatolia. As the blasphemer himself marches against us, we must rally our troops and come to the defense of our brothers in faith. Let us stream through the passes of the Zagros and inflict a crushing defeat on the enemy, lest we forfeit our right to defend the righteous. Ya Ali!" 
 per_eclipse_tamerlane_title: "Eclipse Tamerlane" 
 per_eclipse_tamerlane_desc: "Amir Timur struck fear into the hearts of the world when his armies forged one of the greatest empires in history. Our conquest of Iran, Iraq, Khorasan, Transoxiana, Sham, and Egypt have created an empire surpassing Timur’s. Let the lion and sun fly above all four corners of the earth, for the felicitous light of Hazrat Ali has enlightened our rule, its brilliance shining beyond the wildest dreams of our venerable ancestors." 
 per_city_prince_lava_title: "City of Prince Lava"
 per_city_prince_lava_desc: "Lahore is a magnificent city of mosques, shrines, khanqahs, madrasas, markets, and Hindu temples pulsing with the wealth of all of Hindustan. Supporting this great city's urban development by sponsoring Sufi foundations and our own public projects will elevate it to even greater heights as Hindustan's undisputed cultural capital." 
 per_between_two_rivers_title: "Between Two Rivers" 
 per_between_two_rivers_desc: "Between the Ganges and Yamuna Rivers lie the imperial center of the famed Delhi Sultanate. Seizing the cities of Mathura, Agra, and above all - Delhi itself will aid our ambitions of conquering Hindustan while granting us access to the elite Purbia mercenaries of Bhojpur." 
 per_cultivate_artistic_talent_title: "Cultivate Artistic Talent" 
 per_cultivate_artistic_talent_desc: "The Timurid period has left Iran with a rich artistic tradition bolstered by the meticulous craftsmanship of painters, calligraphers, and artisans concentrated in the commercial workshops of Shiraz, Herat, and Tabriz. By sponsoring our own artistic workshops, we can synthesize these different traditions into a new national synthesis, inaugurating a new period of Iranian art under our generous patronage." 
 per_safavid_book_illustration_title: "Book Illumination"
 per_safavid_book_illustration_desc: "Our generous patronage of Kamal al-Din Behzad, Sultan Muhammad, and other esteemed artists of the Herat School have allowed a new generation of skilled painters to come to the fore. Reza Abbasi, Aqa Mirak, Dust Muhammad, Mir Sayyid Ali, and other notable artists sponsored by our court are producing magnificent miniatures marked by increasingly energetic compositions and a greater attention to naturalism. Continuing our patronage will elevate the prestige we have gained in fostering the rise of the emerging Isfahani school of art." 
 per_maintain_checks_balances_title: "Checks & Balances" 
 per_maintain_checks_balances_desc: "Our days as a small Sufi state of Turkmen warrior-raiders are over. The time has come to balance the demands of the estates on which the stability of our state rests. While we may never rid the state of factional infighting, we can appease the estates and ensure our place above them by strengthening institutions such as reciprocal gift-giving, tribal appeals to personal loyalty, and marrying the sons of our dynasty to the daughters of elite families."
 per_curb_qizilbash_influence_title: "Qizilbash Influence" 
 per_curb_qizilbash_influence_desc: "The Turkmen qizilbash tribes have repeatedly defied our authority by assassinating our wakils, rising in rebellion, and attempting to puppet the shah himself. We must curb their influence by empowering the non-Turkmen elements of our army and administration, particularly the emerging class of ghulam slave-soldiers and bureaucrats from the Caucasus."
 per_reform_second_pillar_title: "Reform the Second Pillar" 
 per_reform_second_pillar_desc: "As the militant Turco-Mongol nomadism that dominated the first few decades of our rule continues to dissipate, the need for a military class capable of supplanting the qizilbash grows. While the expansion of the qurchis has provided our state with an ample force loyal to the shah, the final step is to empower the ghulam slave-soldiers and bureaucrats recruited from the Caucasus. We will do so by organizing them into a standing army personally loyal to the shah while giving them powerful positions in the bureaucracy to ensure that our grip over the state remains strong."
 per_pay_the_zakat_title: "Support the Osulis" 
 per_pay_the_zakat_desc: "The recent eruption of the akbari-osuli religious controversy among Iran’s religious establishment presents a prime opportunity to subordinate the obstinate ulama to the needs of our state. Supporting the works of al-Muhaqqiq al-Karaki, who embraced the osuli principle of ijtihad (interpretation) in his defense of our state as a worldly power acting as the spiritual custodian of the Shi’a community in the absence of the Twelfth Imam may cement our claim to divinely ordained rule while giving us the spiritual authority to place the administration of waqf (religious endowments) under the supervision of the central bureaucracy." 
 per_baku_ateshgah_title: "Baku Ateshgah"
 per_baku_ateshgah_desc: "Hindu and Parsi merchants from Hindustan have established a great temple near Baku, the capital of the Shirvanshahs. We must honor this temple with a mighty atash behram to proclaim the resurgence of our faith!" 
 per_ishtar_gate_title: "Ishtar Gate" 
 per_ishtar_gate_desc: "News has reached the court that farmers have uncovered the remains of a magnificent structure near the city of Hillah. Further excavations have revealed a castle covered with brilliant blue tiles adorned with exquisite reliefs of lions and elaborate bands of floral motifs. Its distance of 12 farsang from the Taq-e Kisra of the Sassanid capital has led our historians to identify it with the legendary Kayanian king Bahram. Let us restore this monument to its former glory to link our dynasty with those of the past!" 
 per_defend_zoroastrianism_title: "Defend Zoroastrianism"
 per_defend_zoroastrianism_desc: "Now that our faith is resurgent, we will announce to the world our intention defend it by invoking the 30th line of the Warharan Yasht dedicated to the mighty Verethragna, divinity of victory: “We sacrifice unto Verethragna, made by Ahura, who makes virility, who makes death, who makes resurrection, who possesses peace, who has a free way. Unto him did the holy Zarathustra offer up a sacrifice, asking for victorious thinking, victorious doing, victorious addressing, and victorious answering.”"
 per_crowning_shah_title: "Crowning of a Shah" 
 per_crowning_shah_desc: "Our relationship with the qizilbash has historically been that of morshed-e kamel to murid (Sufi master to disciple), allowing our dynasty to command absolute obedience as both head of state and divinely-ordained universal ruler. The conquest of Tabriz has secured our status as the undisputed masters of Azerbaijan, ensuring the continued loyalty of the Rumlu, Shamlu, Takkalu, Ostajlu, and Dulkadir qizilbash tribes. Let us ride into the great citadel of the Ilkhanid imperial capital and proclaim our resolve to spread Imamiyyah and bring the rest of Iran under our rule."
 per_turkmen_tribes_title: "The Turkmen Tribes" 
 per_turkmen_tribes_desc: "The unification of Iran has cemented our status as defenders of the faith. Stories of our zealous commitment to the never-ending struggle for righteousness in the name of Hazrat Ali have attracted Turkmen Shi'a from Syria, Iraq, and Anatolia willing to die for our cause. Let us create the office of the khalifeh al-kholafa to establish a religious propaganda network to attract adherents and integrate them into the swelling ranks of the qizilbash to realize our universal ambitions." 
 per_city_holiness_title: "City of Holiness"
 per_city_holiness_desc: "The conquest of Sham has granted us the great cities of Aleppo, Damascus, Tripoli, and above all - Al-Quds, the holy city itself. Our possession of the bustling ports of Syria and the holy cities of Palestine is an important step to realizing our ambitions of controlling the lucrative East-West trade and Hajj routes to Mecca and Medina." 
 per_war_lions_title: "War of the Lions" 
 per_war_lions_desc: "The Mamluk Sultans are rich but paralyzed by factional infighting. If we are to end their pretensions to regional dominance and control the lucrative East-West trade, we must seize the bustling ports of the Delta and break their power once and for all." 
 per_sar_i_hind_title: "Sar-i Hind" 
 per_sar_i_hind_desc: "Sirhind is a well-known center of culture whose prime position on the Grand Trunk Road between Lahore and Delhi has earned it a reputation as the "gateway to Hindustan." With this in mind, its capture would let us claim the mantle of the Delhi Sultanate in our quest to conquer the riches of Hindustan." 
 per_conquer_hindustan_title: "Conquer Hindustan"
 per_conquer_hindustan_desc: "Hindustan is an incredibly wealthy land of millions dispersed across the hundreds of cities that dot its fertile fields like stars in the sky. On the eve of its conquest it is increasingly clear that it will be the jewel of our empire, and that our empire will be so much greater for having it in its crown." 
 per_into_bengal_title: "Into Bengal" 
 per_into_bengal_desc: "Bengal’s thriving ports bustling with the frenzied activity of merchants from across the world, productive workshops stirring with the hum of industry, and magnificent mosques whose halls are blessed to hear the soothing sermons of Sufi saints are a testament to its riches. Let us seize this land to strengthen our links to the lands of China, Japan, and the Malay Archipelago. The lion and sun will rise triumphant over the tiger." 
 per_build_bazaars_title: "Build the Bazaars"
 per_build_bazaars_desc: "Our cities are endowed with vast bazaars forming expansive complexes of covered streets flanked by arcades housing shops, bakeries, coffeehouses, lodges, and workshops. Supporting our merchants by building, renovating, and expanding the bazaars will help harness the wealth flowing through our land."
 per_splendid_court_title: "Splendid Court" 
 per_splendid_court_desc: "The glory of our dynasty depends on the prestige of our illustrious court. Continuing our extensive patronage of art and culture will strengthen our political authority, allowing us to accelerate our practice of converting the land of the state (mamalek) under the administration of qizilbash tribes and local notables to that of the crown (khassa)." 
 per_new_steed_title: "A New Steed" 
 per_new_steed_desc: "The strength of our army has traditionally been the tribal cavalry at our service. Let us strengthen our troops by breeding a noble steed capable of mounting the world under its mighty hooves." 
 per_sword_islam_title: "Sword of Islam" 
 per_sword_islam_desc: "The time has come to let the world know of our intention to protect the faith. While our rise to power has been anything but easy, we have risen to the occasion and triumphed over all who dare oppose us." 
 per_enforce_religious_unity_title: "Enforce Religious Unity"
 per_enforce_religious_unity_desc: "We rule a diverse realm of Shi’a, Sunni, Christians, and Jews whose foreign faiths are different from our own. If we are to guide the people towards the ever-shining light of the Mazdayasni creed, we must sow the seeds of conversion by directing the popular piety of the people toward the creation of a new religious synthesis." 
 per_subzevar_title: "Road to Sabzevar"
 per_subzevar_desc: "Along with Adar Farnbag and Adar Gushnasp, Adar Burzen-Mihr is one of the three great fires of ancient Iran. Shapur Bharuchi’s rivayat states that the Turanian king Arjasp, having killed the Kayanian king Kay Lohrasp, approached the fire to extinguish it. The fire miraculously vanished and reappeared in the Ridge of Vishtasp near Mt. Revand. Thanks to the diligent efforts of our brilliant scholars, we have miraculously found the fire near the city of Kashmar. Let us grant this great fire a temple worthy of its status!" 
 per_raise_qizilbash_title: "Raise the Qizilbash" 
 per_raise_qizilbash_desc: "Shaikh Jonayd’s time among the Turkmen tribes of eastern Anatolia during his exile at the hands of the Qara Qoyunlu has attracted a cadre of fanatically loyal adherents. Their name, meaning “red head” in Turkish, alludes to their red hats, whose twelve peaks represent allegiance to our shaikh and the Twelve Imams. Their devotion sometimes bordered on fanaticism, venerating our shaikhs as an incarnation of God and throwing themselves into battle without fear for their lives. Now that we have elevated ourselves from the status of sheikh to shah, the time has come to call on the qizilbash and rise to battle!" 
 per_land_mountains_title: "Land of Mountains"
 per_land_mountains_desc: "The mountains of Gilan, Tabarestan, and Gurgan give way to the fertile low-lying plains of the Caspian coast. This region is immensely productive and may yield great dividends in the form of profits from its silk and agriculture industries. Let us defeat the defiant northerners to bring this region under our rule!" 
 per_consolidate_persia_title: "Consolidate Persia"
 per_consolidate_persia_desc: "Decades of fighting among the Timurid princes and Turkmen padishahs have caused the people to suffer and the fields to lay fallow. Famine stalks the land as the forces of chaos and disunion reign supreme. Recent victories in light of our proclamation as the rightful rulers of Iran at Tabriz have led the people to look to us to sweep away the tyrants who have ruined the land. Let us prove ourselves the true shahs of Iran!" 
 per_city_peace_title: "City of Peace"
 per_city_peace_desc: "As the site of the burial and martyrdom of many of our holiest saints, imams, and ahl al-bayt, Iraq-e Arab is a sacred land that looms large in the Shi’a consciousness from which we draw our legitimacy. Bringing the venerable shrines of our imams under our protection will affirm our status as defenders of the faith and custodians of the Shi’a community. We must bring Najaf, Karbala, and the great city of Baghdad under our protection!" 
 per_timurid_decay_title: "Timurid Decay" 
 per_timurid_decay_desc: "News of Shah Rukh’s death has shattered the mighty Timurid Empire into pieces. While distinguished conquerors like Abu Sai’d Mirza have risen to the challenge in their bids to reunite the empire, it is increasingly clear that decades of internal strife have rendered any lasting peace impossible. We must take advantage of the Timurid princes’ precipitous decline and put an end to their rule!" 
 per_city_stone_title: "City of Stone" 
 per_city_stone_desc: "Amir Timur and his princely successors elevated Samarkand to one of the greatest cities the world had ever seen. The soaring domes and brilliant tiles of its magnificent monuments such as the Gur-e Amir, the Bibi Khanym mosque, and the Ulugh Beg madrasa will undoubtedly inspire generations of architects. Restoring these monuments to their former glory is sure to leave our mark on this glorious city." 
 per_caravanserais_title: "Caravanserais"
 per_caravanserais_desc: "Caravanserais are roadside inns for merchants and travelers. Typically taking the form of a rectangular courtyard surrounded by rooms, larger complexes can include mosques, shops, bakeries, kitchens, public baths, post offices, signal towers, and stables. While previous dynasties have left an impressive network of caravanserais, we must expand this network through an ambitious public works program to capitalize on the lucrative trade routes running through our land." 
 per_encourage_persian_poetry_title: "Encourage Persian Poetry"
 per_encourage_persian_poetry_desc: "Despite Iran's storied tradition of epic poetry stretching back to the early days of the Sassanids, our relative lack of interest in sponsoring literature has prompted the departure of poets from our country for the relatively generous patronage of the Mughal and Ottoman courts. Furthermore, the recent publication of brilliant philosophical treatises by Sheikh Bahai, Mulla Sadra, and other Illuminationist scholars of the Isfahan School of philosophy on metaphysics, existentialist cosmology, and the nature of faith have led many to question the relative dearth of literary output. We must reverse this trend and sponsor our country's poets so that our literary scene may blossom."
 per_greater_khorasan_title: "Great Khorasan"
 per_greater_khorasan_desc: "With Kerman, Birjand, and above all, the Hazrat Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad under our rule, we have opened the way to a great conquest of Khorasan. Let us put the Pearl of Khorasan to siege and strike into the heart of the dying Timurid Empire!"
 per_worthy_capital_title: "A Worthy Capital"
 per_worthy_capital_desc: "The constant factional infighting at the court in Qazvin has prompted the shah to begin preparations for the transfer of the capital to Isfahan, chosen for its proximity to the Zayanderud and vast tracts of open space. We will embark on an ambitious urban planning program to transform this regional town into a great metropolis of magnificent mosques, sprawling madrasas, bustling bazaars, opulent palaces, blooming gardens, and sweeping avenues whose glory will be equal to that of half the entire earth."
 per_spread_imamiyyah_title: "Spread the Imamiyyah"
 per_spread_imamiyyah_desc: "The unification of Iran after decades of disunion has finally lent us the spiritual and political authority to spread our faith. We come from a diverse land of Sunnis, Nizari Ismailiyyah, Naqshbandiyyah, Qadiriyyah, Hurufiyyah, Christians, Jews, and Zoroastrians. We must honor our responsibility as morshed-e kamel and use the bonds that unite us to free them from their ignorance." 
 per_najf_karbala_title: "Najaf & Karbala"
 per_najf_karbala_desc: "While our custodianship of the Hazrat Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad and the Fatima Masumeh shrine in Qom has earned the admiration of our Shi’a subjects, the holy cities of Najaf and Karbala remain in the hands of heretics. Bringing them under our protection would mean that the burial place of Imam Ali, his sons Imam Husayn and Hazrat Abbas, and the site of their martyrdom are finally under Shi’a rule."
 per_unify_islam_title: "Unify Islam" 
 per_unify_islam_desc: "Glory to God, most gracious, most merciful. We have done what no Shi’a dynasty has managed to do and unify the Muslim world under the lion and sun. Our dynasty reigns supreme as the name of our illustrious shah is recited in khutbah prayers from Morocco to Malacca. Our outstanding victory has shown the world that Islam is resurgent and that we alone are suited to the task of assuming its mantle."

 per_faithful_larestan_desc: "Tradition states that the Prophet Zartosht urged the Kayanian king Goshtasp to search for a fire venerated by Jamshid, the fourth of the eleven Pishdadian kings. When such a fire was found in Khwarezm, it was taken to Fars where it was inaugurated as the Adur Farnbag atash behram, one of the three main fires of ancient Iran. When the Arabs conquered our land, the fire was divided in two - one kept at Karyan and the other at Fasa. While the original atash behram is long gone, let us honor its memory by inaugurating another at Karyan."
 per_iranshah_atash_behram_title: "Iranshah Atash Behram" 
 per_iranshah_atash_behram_desc: "The Parsis of Hindustan have diligently aided us in our efforts to spread the faith across Iran. With their principal religious site the great Iranshah Atash Behram at Udvada, our brothers across the Khyber have reliably helped us maintain our rites and traditions through centuries of oppression. We must return the favor by bringing them under our benevolent protection and expanding their temple to unite the Parsi and Irani communities!"
 per_passage_basra_title: "Passage to Basra"
 per_passage_basra_desc: "The mountain passes of the lands of the Kurds and Lurs provide valuable access to the fertile plains of Khuzestan. Controlling these passes would open the way to the floodplains of the Arvandrud, and beyond that - the great port of al-Basra." 
 per_fertile_crescent_title: "Fertile Crescent"
 per_fertile_crescent_desc: "The great port of al-Basra is a vital conduit for the Indian Ocean trade and pilgrimage traffic to Mecca and Medina. Constantly plagued by bandits and disease, the alluvial swamps of southern Iraq-e Arab will be difficult to bring under our control. In our quest to conquer Khuzestan and al-Basra itself, we would do well to bring the Shi’a Musha'sha'iyyah tribal confederation into the fold appointing one of our own as their leader so that they may assist us in our conquest of al-Basra." 
 per_kingdom_of_hormuz_title: "Kingdom of Hormuz"
 per_kingdom_of_hormuz_desc: "The island of Hormuz is a focal point for the shipment of goods through the Indian Ocean trade. While the rulers of Hormuz have historically placated us through regular payments of tribute, rumors that the Portuguese are casting a jealous eye on their island have made it clear that we must strike while we can and bring them under our protection."
 per_reach_arabia_felix_title: "Reach Arabia Felix"
 per_reach_arabia_felix_desc: "The disunion of Yemen is a dire threat to its Shi’a community. We must act on our responsibility as defenders of the faith by bringing our Zaidi brothers under our generous protection." 
 per_crush_asian_tribes_title: "Crush the Uzbeks" 
 per_crush_asian_tribes_desc: "Our holdings in Khorasan are far from secure. Led by Muhammad Shaybani Khan, the Uzbeks have seized Mawarannahr and are staging regular raids into our territory. Recently ousted from Samarkand, the Timurid prince Zahir al-Din Muhammad Babur has promised to mint coins and have the khutbah recited in our name if we were to assist him in reclaiming his land from the Uzbeks. Taking him up on his offer may help secure our northern frontier with the added benefit of granting us stewardship over the fabulously wealthy cities of the Land Between the Rivers." 
 per_silk_road_title: "The Silk Road" 
 per_silk_road_desc: "Our conquest of Khorasan and the distant lands of Mawarannahr has endowed with an expansive network of trade routes that could yield enormous profits if we were to harness their potential. Sponsoring the lucrative silk trade and strengthening ties with the Great Ming to improve our production techniques will make us all the more wealthy." 
 per_fund_textile_industry_title: "Fund the Textile Industry" 
 per_fund_textile_industry_desc: "The great workshops of Isfahan, Kashan, Rasht, and Yazd are famous for their textiles of brilliant color, complicated craftsmanship, and intricate design. Particularly famous are their carpets adorned with birds, clouds, trees, flowers, and geometric patterns articulated by silk and metal threads whose workmanship has attained the status of fine art. Sponsoring the textile industry by building workshops and declaring the export of silk a royal monopoly is sure to be a boon for our coffers." 
 per_ali_qapu_title: "Ali Qapu"
 per_ali_qapu_desc: "Our efforts have made the noble city of Isfahan the greatest in the world! Its magnificent maidan is unparalleled in its glory and would be made all the more great if we were to inaugurate a grand palace from which the person of the shah can project the radiant power of our state." 
 per_golden_era_title: "Golden Era of Persia"
 per_golden_era_desc: "Our generous patronage of painting, calligraphy, textiles, ceramics, architecture, urban planning, philosophy, and religious scholarship have blossomed forth into a golden age of prosperity. Coins bearing the name of our shah circulate in markets across the world as copies of our literature are printed as far as China and the land of the Franks. The whole world looks upon Iran with envy, for the radiance of our glory shines brighter than the sun." 
 per_import_chinese_ceramics_title: "Chinese Ceramics"
 per_import_chinese_ceramics_desc: "Our state-sponsored workshops have been producing brilliant polychrome tiles adorning our architecture with billowing sprays, floral arabesques, and interlaced lettering. Among their products are glazed ceramics featuring Chinese-influenced dragons, phoenixes, cranes, and clouds. The increasing popularity of Ming ceramics among the Franks, Arabs, and Ottoman Turks has made it clear that we may benefit by importing Chinese potters to produce ceramics of luster, quality, and above all, value, rivaling those of the Great Ming itself." 
 per_holy_cities_islam_title: "Holy Cities of Islam" 
 per_holy_cities_islam_desc: "The Ottomans have blocked the Hajj routes to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, harassing Shi’a pilgrims and preventing them from entering the al-Baqi cemetery where numerous sahabah, ahl al-bayt, and four of our imams are buried. We must respond to this egregious provocation with force and liberate the Masjid al-Haram!" 
 per_custodians_jerusalem_title: "Custodians of Jerusalem"
 per_custodians_jerusalem_desc: "The third holiest site of our faith is the Haram al-Sharif of al-Quds where God commanded Ibrahim to bind Ishaq and the Prophet Muhammad mounted the buraq and ascended to Heaven in Isra and Miraj. Now that the holy cities of Mecca, Medina, Najaf, Karbala, Mashhad, and Qom are under our hands, we must set our sights on al-Quds and bring the Haram al-Sharif under our rule!"
 per_khiva_title: "Ancient City of Urva" 
 per_khiva_desc: "Tradition states that the lands of Khwarezm were once under the control of our esteemed forefathers. We must follow in the footsteps of the Kayanian king Kay Khosrow and send an expedition into the land of Turan to claim it for our faith. Once the lands of Afrasiyab are under our rule, we will commemorate our resounding victory by building a magnificent ateshgah in Khiva."

 FU_Persia_Events.1.d: "Conquest always brings new people into our fold. For the Georgians, honourable fighters of the Caucasus, fate devised their downfall at the hands of [Root.Monarch.GetName]. As the last of their separatist elements are quelled by various means, the question of what shall be done with their population looms above the heads of Shah [Root.Monarch.GetName] and his advisors. Many among the qizilbash suggest we have no need for unruly heathens among our administration. However, there is merit and prospective cultivation in allowing them to flourish harmoniously under our banner..."

His successors planed trees along the city's streets, adorned it with splendid buildings, and generously fostered its traders and craftsmen. \n\nThough Champaner became the Gujarat Sultanate's capital in 1484, Ahmedabad remained its superior, well-defended by its walls, well-supplied by its orchards and gardens, and embellished with well-planned streets, squares, and houses. So closely did the Sultans of Ahmedabad look after its welfare that if they heard of an empty house or shop they ordered it filled. \nAlong with its unparalleled beauty, the city is also the host of a well-known and expansive mosque, the Sarkhej Roza. \nPlanting our banner on the city's walls and using it as a center for administration will undoubtedly help us maintain our grip on the region."

Much of the Indian subcontinent now lies safely under our grasp, and with it, scores of different people from a vast array of faiths and cultural backgrounds. Despite our zealous attention to detail and determination to maintain our identity, it has become apparent that many elements of the conquered Indian people have made its way in the most private crevices of our uniformity.

 FU_Persia_Events.4.d: "From the moment of his accession, Shah [Root.Monarch.GetName] realized that he must impose his authority on the qizilbash or remain their tool. The qizilbash, however, were still the backbone of the military strength of our state; meaning that if he weakened them, he undermined the state. \n\nConsequently, Shah [Root.Monarch.GetName] embarked on a number of internal reforms designed to break the power of the Qizilbash. He did so by creating substitute military and administrative elites. He raised the profile of the ghulam institution, swelling their ranks with thousands of Georgians, Armenians, and Circassians taken captive during the brutal wars in the Caucasus. \n\nHe to form a new standing army composed of recruits from the ranks of the ghulaman-e khassa-ye sharifa (crown servants). The ghulams were largely Georgian, Armenian, and Circassian Christians taken prisoner during the $DYNASTY$ campaigns in the Caucasus (though a small number of Georgian nobles had voluntarily joined the $DYNASTY$ army), converted to our faith, and trained for service in the royal household or administration, akin to the role and function of the Janissaries in the Ottoman Empire."

As a result, the Persians annexed much of Eastern Anatolia and northern Iraq from the Ottomans. It marked the first Persian expansion into the depths of Anatolia (beyond any previous borders) and the end of Ottoman expansion to the east. Chaldiran was just the beginning of several decades of destructive war, which ended only with the Treaty of Isfahan.

The Ulugh Beg Observatory was completed sometime around 1422, with the monarch inviting over skilled astronomers and mathematicians to help build it. Among those he invited were Ghiyath al-Din, Jamshid al-Kashi, Mansur ibn Muin al-Din al-Kashi, Salah al-Din Qadi Zada Rumi, and Ali Qushiji.

 FU_Persia_Events.19.d: "While initially overshadowed by Arabic liturate during the Umayyad and early Abbasid caliphates, New Persian soon became the literary language of Central and West Asia. The rebirth of Persian in its new form is often accredited to the generation of poets exemplified by Ferdowsi, Unsuri, Daqiqi, and Rudaki, who used pre-Islamic identities as a conduit to revive the stories of Sassanid Iran.\n\nWorks of the early era of Persian poetry were characterized by strong court patronage and an extravagance of panegyrics. Khorasani style, whose followers were mostly associated with Greater Khorasan, is characterized by its supercilious diction, dignified tone, and relatively literate language. \n\nHowever, the more recent Indian style of Persian poetry (sometimes called the Safavi or Isfahani style) took over. This style has its roots in the Timurid era and produced the likes of Amir Khosrow Dehlavi and Bhai Nand Lal "Goya"."

 FU_Persia_Events.23.d: "The grandeur of Persian architecture is beginning to grip our nation. New innovations in religious, secular, palatial, and landscape architecture are beginning to take hold. Meanwhile, state-sponsored artists under the particular aegis of Shah Tahmasp have created a brilliant synthesis of Iran’s various styles; thought it nonetheless remained a court rather than national style. Under his successors, the art emanating from our cultural capitals spread across the empire, branding Iran as one of the world's leading melting pots of architecture and the arts."

 FU_Persia_Events.24.t: "Imamzadeh Harun-e Velayat"
 FU_Persia_Events.24.d: "The architectural masterpiece of the early $DYNASTY$ period is the portal of the Imamzadeh Harun-e Velayat in Isfahan, erected around the year [GetYear]. Its patron, Grand Vizier Durmish Khan, is mentioned in a Persian distich over the door. These poetic inscriptions, infrequent in previous buildings, quickly became characteristic of $DYNASTY$ buildings. \nThe complex is curious for its exterior, which falls short of the portal. Attention is given to the exterior facade rather than the internal layout, an amphasis frequently repeated in later $DYNASTY$ buildings. The building is conceived as a frame for lavish decoration rather than as an entity in which each element has its party to play; hence its unassuming design."
 FU_Persia_Events.24.a: "Such a diverse range of styles befits the King of Kings!"
 FU_Persia_Events.25.t: "Ali Mosque"
 FU_Persia_Events.25.d: "Isfahan's Ali Mosque is a four-iwan mosque with a large domed sanctuary and distinctive exterior facade. The sanctuary provides an instructive link between the earlier architecture of the Blue Mosque of Tabriz and the later Mosque of Shaikh Lotfollah. With its numerous arched bays opening at the ground and gallery level, it resembles the earlier building. But the square ground plan and use of four massive pendentives carrying the dome looks ahead to the latter. \nThese pendentives are identical in size and contour to the arches along the main axes. Net vaulting fills the intervening spaces, and a thick circular inscription band completes the transition to the dome. The handsome, spacious proportions of this mosque and its bold reworking of the traditional domed square formula popular among Persian architects makes it a formally outstanding period."
 FU_Persia_Events.25.a: "Beauty and devotion worthy of God!"
 FU_Persia_Events.26.t: "Tomb of Amin al-Din Jibrail"
 FU_Persia_Events.26.d: "The tomb of Amin al-Din Jibrail is one of the first fruits of the $DYNASTY$ Shahs' uninterrupted interest in the Sheikh Safi al-Din khanqah and shrine ensemble at Ardabil, who clearly saw the complex and its dependences as a dynastic shrine. Its form owes a great debt to the domed squares of Timurid Transoxiana, notably the mosque of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi and the Gur-e Amir. Its form is still transitional, not least in the lack of integration between its internal and external layout. The high-drummed dome is set abruptly, without intermediary, on a square, flat-roofed lower story whose box-like appearance is redeemed by the deep axial arched portals. Mausolea such as this would soon replace the classic "tomb tower" favored by earlier architects, offering a far more spacious layout encouraging large-scale pilgrimages." 
 FU_Persia_Events.26.a: "A dynastic shrine to remind us of our roots!"
 FU_Persia_Events.27.t: "Jannat-sara Mosque" 
 FU_Persia_Events.27.d: "The Jannat-Sara mosque is one of the grandest examples of $DYNASTY$ architecture at the Sheikh Safi al-Din complex in Ardabil, representing a generous effort on the part of the shah for the Ardabil shrine's sanctity and place of honor among Iran's monuments. \nInternally, the plan retains its octagonal shape on both stories; each side is occupied by a blind arch enclosing narrow arched niches superposed on one another. \nRather than discouraging access by a forbidding blank wall, the architect has chosen to invite entry into the building through deep bays. The psychological effect produced by this arrangement is fairly different from earlier tombs. Though hints of this approach can be found in earlier buildings, it had never been expressed on this grand a scale." 
 FU_Persia_Events.27.a: "Let our faith shine the path to victory and divinity!"
 FU_Persia_Events.28.t: "Abbas I - Persia's Greatest Emperor" 
 FU_Persia_Events.28.d: "Abbas I, one of our nation's greatest monarchs, came to prominence with his ascension to the Persian throne in [GetYear]. Not one to waste time or leave the state's matters in the hands of viziers and advisors, his plans of grand reforms and the reduction of estate influence in the court were merely the beginning of one of the most enlightened reigns of our time."
 FU_Persia_Events.28.a: "The throne is his!" 
 FU_Persia_Events.28.b: "We could never abandon the status quo."
 FU_Persia_Events.29.t: "Abbas I's Expansion of Isfahan" 
 FU_Persia_Events.29.d: "One must turn to Isfahan to assess Shah Abbas as a patron of architecture. Abbas' succession completely transformed the sorry state of affairs which had prevailed in Iranian architecture for nearly a century, with the dynamism with which the new shah sponsored the expansion of Isfahan inspiring architects to recover the inspiration that had trickled away in the long stagnation of previous reigns. Appropriately enough, Timurid and not early $DYNASTY$ architecture provided the springboard for fresh developments, among which the monuments of Isfahan claim pride of place."
 FU_Persia_Events.29.a: "A magnificent wonder of architecture and urbanism!" 
 FU_Persia_Events.30.t: "Gardens of Chahar Bagh"
 FU_Persia_Events.30.d: "Do you like Shah Abbas I? His early reign was a little too absolutist for my taste. But when his reforms came out in 1593, I think he really came into his own, militarily and administratively. His whole reign has a clear, crisp growth, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives Shah Abbas a big boost. He's been compared to Mehmet II, but I think Abbas has a far more bitter, hands-on approach on administration. \n\nIn [GetYear], Abbas constructed this; the Gardens of Chahar Bagh, one of his most accomplished projects. I think his undisputed masterpiece is Naqsh-e Jahan Square. A square so awe-inspiring, most people probably don't look at its beauty. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of ducats and the importance of trade. It's also a personal statement about the Iranian Architecture itself." 
 FU_Persia_Events.30.a: "Such remarkable beauty!"
 FU_Persia_Events.31.t: "Naqsh-e Jahan Square"
 FU_Persia_Events.31.d: "The Chahar Bagh and Naqsh-e Jahan square were the key features of Abbas' expansion of Isfahan, providing a framework within which subsequent buildings would be fitted. Much of their importance depended on their size, with the square measuring 512 by 159 meters - larger than mostly comparable European plazas.\n\nIts apparent size is magnificent by its low-lying buildings, fronted by a low two-story arcade defining its limits. The buildings accessed by the arcade are primarily functional; shops occupy the first floor while dwellings occupy the second. Their lowness has the further aesthetic impact of exalting the stature of the four buildings that break through the facade; the Shah Mosque, the Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque, the Ali Qapu Palace, and the entrance portal of the Qeysarie Bazaar.\n\nShah Abbas completed the square by adding a monumental portal at the center of each side, granting access to the four aforementioned buildings. With these portals, the square could be interpreted as a gigantic version of the classic four-iwan courtyard which, found in mosques, madrasas, houses, and caravanserais, maintained so tenacious a hold on the imagination of Iranian architects.\nNone of these buildings intruded onto the main central space, whose vast emptiness allowed the square to play a varied role in the life of the city. In turn marketplace, military training and parade ground, execution dock, polo pitch, open-air stage, running track, and arena for animal combats, it was a magnificently illuminated funfair by night and the inevitable center for all kinds of royal entertainments. Its legendary reputation earned it the name by which it is known today; Image of the World." 
 FU_Persia_Events.31.a: "Come one, come all!"
 FU_Persia_Events.32.t: "Shah Mosque"
 FU_Persia_Events.32.d: "Renowned for its quality of serenity and confident marshalling of large spaces, the Shah Mosque is one of Iran's most famous $DYNASTY$ monuments. Its construction, the work of Ustad 'Ali Akbar al-Isfahani under the direction of Muhibb 'Ali Kika Lala spanned some twenty years. Measuring 52 meters (some 14 meters above the inner dome), no other Persian mosque has a double dome so high. Its broad court, measuring some 70 meters across, was enthusiastically copied by Qajar architects. All these extra requirements were prodigal of space, which accounts for the mosque's huge area of some 140 by 130 meters at its greatest extent. \nThough the mosque's four-iwan plan ostensibly accords with the classical tradition of Persian Islamic architecture, variations of the familiar schema meet the eye at every turn. The east and west iwans lead to domed chambers, a layout customarily reserved for the qibla side alone. Minarets crown both the portal and qibla iwan. \nPerhaps the most unexpected addition, however, is the pair of custom-built madrasas flanking the sanctuary complex. Identical in form, they exhibit the same urge for symmetry that marks the rest of the mosque, giving it an exterior as streamlined as the interior layout." 
 FU_Persia_Events.32.a: "The most prestigious Persian mosque with a double dome!"
 FU_Persia_Events.33.t: "Madrasa-e Khan" 
 FU_Persia_Events.33.d: "Built by a certain Husain Sama'i, the Madrasa-e Khan in Shiraz is perhaps the most interesting $DYNASTY$ madrasa. Some of its details, like the fine stonecutting of its walls, stone-carved dragons, and the distinctive tilework of its vestibule show signs of a highly original local style. Meanwhile, its sheer size provides ample evidence that the emphasis for monumentality which so often recurds in the building of Isfahan was by no means confined to the capital or royal foundations. \nWhile the building employs a standard four-iwan plan, the general lack of symmetry within this framework is marked. Only the north and south sides share similarities in their two stories of student cells. \nThe plan's communal areas, including the vaulted apsidal iwan, are to the east rather than the usual qibla side or entrance complex. Moreover, the madrasa has no separate mosque as the southwest iwan perpendicular to the entrance fulfills this function." 
 FU_Persia_Events.33.a: "A curious blend of embellished architecture, piety, and education."
 FU_Persia_Events.34.t: "Chehel Sotoun"
 FU_Persia_Events.34.d: "Owing to its idyllic garden ambience, the Chehel Sotoun is one of the most famous Persian palaces. Like many other $DYNASTY$ palaces, the Chehel Sotoun has a deliberately unstable and impermanent air. Thus, some flavor of the festive, hedonistic lifestyle celebrated there still lingers. \nIts eighteen pillars, seeming as thin as matchsticks, seem preposterously inadequate to bear the burden of the apparently massive flat roof. The name, Forty Columns, refers to the reflection of these columns in the water, is surely a reflection of the picturesque fantasy the palace offers. \nLike the Ali Qapu, however, this palace offers an aspect of four-square solidity from its sides and rear, which is in marked contrast from its frail and insubstantial facade. In contrast to the main facade, the rear wall presents a solid mass of masonry from which the principal break is the rear entrance. Despite it trabeated form, it owes more to Sassanid palaces than any other traceable source, for the deep recessed central bay leading to the throne room operates like a Sassanid iwan." 
 FU_Persia_Events.34.a: "Regality and decorum!"
 FU_Persia_Events.35.t: "The Shah's Academy" 
 FU_Persia_Events.35.d: "The Madar-e Shah madrasa, caravanserai, and bazaar is an unexpected return to the grandiose planning of Shah Abbas, representing the principal achievement of $DYNASTY$ architecture after the 1630s. \n\nIts merits lie in the serene, almost rational disposition of the three constituent units. The madrasa and caravanserai are oriented along the same eastward axis, marked by the entrance portal of the madrasa and continued in the pools of both buildings, which extend even to the stables closing off the complex at the west end. A pathway and pool divide the courtyard into four miniature gardens, perhaps intended as a peaceful echo of the wider Chahar Bagh outside. To the north, the bazaar knits together the two larger buildings. It comprises a single broad corridor some 220 meters in length symmetrically bordered by multiple arcades on both sides. \n\nThe scale is impressive and the planning is rational and meticulous to the last detail. The confident marshalling of such large forms would be a heritage bequeathed to the later Zand and Qajar architects, and is arguable the greatest strength of Persian architecture in post-$DYNASTY$ times." 
 FU_Persia_Events.35.a: "Royal education shines through the study of Iranian scripture!"
 FU_Persia_Events.36.t: "$DYNASTY$ Wall Painting Under Abbas I"
 FU_Persia_Events.36.d: "The $DYNASTY$ period has left a legacy of wall painting incomparably richer than the sum total which survives from previous periods. The Chehel Sotoun and Ali Qapu palaces host ambitious figural schemes preserved in much of their original splendour. They show an almost total dependence on the repertoire of contemporary book illumination, with its emphasis on intimate courtly scenes and occasional (frankly erotic) flavor. \n\nAt Ali Qapu, for instance, the artists declined to exploit the varied wall surface available to them, preferring to reproduce on a larger scale the rectangular frames of book illumination. As a result, the palace becomes what amounts to a picture gallery, an impression strengthened by the eye-level height of these artificial panels and the deliberately muted floral or other non-figural motifs which fill the intervening spaces. Thus, this interstitial decoration operates as a kind of wallpaper." 
 FU_Persia_Events.36.a: "Such breathtaking compositional changes!"
 FU_Persia_Events.37.t: "Shahnameh of $MONARCH$"
 FU_Persia_Events.37.d: "Shortly after his glorious accession, [Root.Monarch.GetName] ordered the creation of a royal Shahnameh. The production of this great book of 759 pages and 258 paintings by the leading masters of the Shah's library was to continue for the next two decades. Its pages reflect the development of painting during the early part of [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s reign, as a manuscript as large as the Shahnameh utilizes the skills of a wide range of painters, calligraphers, and artistic directors. Particularly famous are the folios by the esteemed painter Sultan Muhammad, whose work shows the emergence of a measured synthesis of Behzadian reason and Turkmen energy. With its meticulous detail, unparalleled draftsmanship, energetic composition, and brilliant colors, Sultan Muhammad's famous rendering of the Court of Gayumars was given special praise, for it was regarded as the zenith of $DYNASTY$ painting, for the hearts of the boldest painters were grieved, and they hung their head in shame before it."

Their mission is to spread the military expertise of Europe's most fearsome armies and bring our two nations closer against common enemies. \n\nRobert Shirley was the third son of Sir Thomas Shirley of Wiston, Sussex, and Anne Kempe, the daughter of Sir Thomas Kempe of Olantigh in Wye, Kent.

 FU_encouraged_art_desc: "There is a huge cultural tradition of Art in the lands of the Persians. From a government perspective this is stuff that people want to buy. The encouragement of art will give our merchants more things to sell abroad boosting the wealth of our nation."
 FU_promotion_of_irrigation: "Promote Irrigation" 
 FU_promotion_of_irrigation_desc: "If we encourage agriculture, we will increase our population so we will have more manpower for our army."
 FU_the_ghulams: "The Ghulams"
 FU_the_ghulams_desc: ""Previously our army has been heavily dependent on Feudal levies (Qizilbash) who have proved to be more to loyal themselves than the throne. We will found a standing army of professional infantry and cavalry, whose loyalty is to the Shah first, to defend the country."
 FU_improved_silk_road: "The Silk Road"  
 FU_improved_silk_road_desc: "A system of upgrades to roads and bridges, a system of guards to protect the roads (for a small tax) and a chain of Caravanserai to provide rest stops. All help the merchants as they traverse the silk road and also provide increased revenues for the state."
 #Government Reforms
 fu_indian_sultanate_reform: "Empowered Indian Sultanate"
 fu_indian_sultanate_reform_desc: "Ruled by a Muslim minority the Sultanates of India have had to evolve and expand the traditional Muslim ideas of Kingship. While they remain Islamic states the role of the Dhimmi, traditionally encompassing Jews and Christians, have been extended to the Dharmic religions."

 qar_white_sheeep_title: "The White Sheep" 
 qar_white_sheeep_desc: "The Aq Qoyunlu are our small, but ferocious cousins. None amongst them being more ferocious than Uzun Hasan. We must subjugate them, lest they grow powerful enough to do the same to us."
 qar_qom_rebellion_title: "Qom Rebellion"
 qar_qom_rebellion_desc: "Shah Rukh is dead. The ambitious Prince Muhammad bin Baysonqor has revolted, his powerbase centred in Qom. Rebellion stirs elsewhere in Timur’s Empire, and it seems as though there would be little stopping us from marching across the Zagros mountains and seizing the rebels’ lands for ourselves."
 qar_timurid_politics_title: "Timurid Politics" 
 qar_timurid_politics_desc: "The descendents of Timur Gurkani fight amongst themselves like a pack of feral dogs, slaughtering each other in a contest to see who shall rule over the bones left behind. They require little persuasion from us to turn on eachother, hollow promises of support making them squabble even further. Once all is done, none shall stand strong enough to prevent us from cleaning up the mess they leave behind." 
 qar_thalathat_abna_title: "Thalathat Abna"
 qar_thalathat_abna_desc: "Before we make any attempts to broaden our influence in the Levant, we must first settle the matter of succession between our Sultan’s three most prominent and rebellious sons. Once our internal divisions are set aside, there is no doubt that the Black Sheep shall rise."
 qar_khalwati_order_title: "Khalwati Order"
 qar_khalwati_order_desc: "Now that we have conquered Shirvan, we must integrate and patronize the Khalwati Order, a sufi sect popular amongst many of our soldiers. There is no doubt that their rugged individualism will aid us in defending our northern border."  
 qar_markets_sari_title: "Markets of Sari"
 qar_markets_sari_desc: "The Caspian coast of Persia remains its most fertile and commercially active region, ships and caravans both docking in the important port of Sari, trading in silks, spices, and all other manner of luxury goods. The petty Shahs and Sheikhs ruling over the coastline have little hope in stopping us from seizing these important lands for ourselves." 
 qar_alesr_al_abyad_title: "Alesr al' Abyad"
 qar_alesr_al_abyad_desc: "We are the Masters of Persia, Iraq, Armenia, and Georgia. Though with our conquests, we have not wrought destruction onto people as previous regimes might have. Instead, our loyal subjects prosper under our Sultan’s supervision. Merchants grow fat on the trade of the silk road, and the memory of the famines left by the wake of the conquests of Timur are slowly fading, as year after year the grain surplus grows larger. Our cities grow, our coffers fill and our people cheer in support of the great Sultan who has brought them such prosperity."
 qar_mushashaiyya_title: "Musha'sha'iyyah"
 qar_mushashaiyya_desc: "The militant millenarians of Basra and Khuzestan have undoubtedly been a thorn in our sides, Muhammad ibn Falah stirring up unrest with his teachings. If properly harnessed, however, the Musha’sha’iyyah would make for formidable allies in our conquests." 
 qar_unite_horse_tribes_title: "Unite the Horse Tribes" 
 qar_unite_horse_tribes_desc: "We have subdued the Georgians, Kurds, Armenians, Musha’sha’iyyah, Safavids and Shirvanshahs. The thunder of our warhorses has been heard from Basra to Tbilisi, and none can question that our great Sultan is a man as great as those horse lords that came before him. The name of the Black Sheep shall be spoken of in histories in the same breath as the Seljuks and Mongols." 
 qar_blue_mosque_title: "The Blue Mosque"
 qar_blue_mosque_desc: "One of our Great Sultan’s wives, Khatun Jan Begum, has sadly passed from this life to the next. Being a generous soul, all of her wealth has been donated as a Waqf for the establishment of a Grand Mosque in Tabriz. Our Sultan, moved by her generosity, has invited architects from Baghdad to begin the construction." 
 qar_muzafariyya_title: "Muzafariyya"
 qar_muzafariyya_desc: "Our capital of Tabriz, nestled in the Zagros mountains, has grown to be a city of great note; one of the greatest in Persia and the Levant. Merchants from all manner of places come to purchase our fine silks, and a great many public works have been erected, the Blue Mosque being the greatest among them."
 qar_desturi_jahan_bey_title: "Desturi Jahan Bey"
 qar_desturi_jahan_bey_desc: "Once merely a petty confederation of various Turkomen tribes, as our power has grown as has our capability in administration. To consolidate his power, our Sultan has brought forward various reforms in governance, prime amongst them being a code of laws based on a fusion of Sharia and our Turkic Customary Law. No longer shall our sophisticated neighbours look down onto us as lawless barbarians." 
 qar_till_northern_land_title: "Till the Northern Land"
 qar_till_northern_land_desc: "The Caucasus Mountains serve as a formidable natural border for us to guard our lands from incursions by the Tatars and Circassians. Our current border with the Christian Georgians is precarious at best, and they would be far more useful to us as guardians of our Northern frontier." 
 qar_bestowed_by_god_title: "Bestowed by God"
 qar_bestowed_by_god_desc: "Baghdad was once the greatest city of the Islamic World. Some would argue, even, that it was the greatest city of the entire world. Over the last few centuries, however, Baghdad has fallen on hard times. Conquered by Seljuks, Mongols, and dozens of others. Now that Baghdad is firmly under our control, we have the opportunity to restore the city to its former glory."
 qar_appease_emirates_title: "Appease the Emirates"
 qar_appease_emirates_desc: "Whilst our vassals aren’t particularly unruly and would be unlikely to directly oppose us, there’s little doubt that their loyalties could very quickly change should the winds not blow in our favor. We must make sure that they love us; and failing that, that they fear us." 
 qar_edict_collaboration_title: "Edict of Collaboration"
 qar_edict_collaboration_desc: "Just to the north of our capital are the Armenians. Our two peoples have lived beside each other for hundreds of years now, though they chafe under our rule regardless. Should they rebel, there is no doubt we would crush them, though our Sultan believes that if we were to accept the Armenians into our administration, they would bring many of their useful skills with them, and be grateful for the opportunity to serve us." 
 qar_deal_copts_title: "Deal with the Armenians"
 qar_deal_copts_desc: "The Armenians are now securely a part of our state, and are no longer at risk of rebelling. One matter remains unresolved, however; the matter of their faith. We are pious Muslims, and some in our court would support bringing them into the fold of Islam. Other, more forward-thinking councillors suggest we extend privileges onto them, allowing them to practice their faith as fellow people of the book."
 qar_pursue_religious_unity_title: "Pursue Religious Unity"
 qar_pursue_religious_unity_desc: "We Black Sheep are Shia, followers of the Imam Isma’il ibn Jafar, though many of our subjects are not. Many are Christian, and many more still are Sunni. In truth, we are a minority in our own lands, something that must change going forward, lest we succumb to internal division." 
 qar_quell_mashriqi_dissent_title: "Mashriqi Dissent"
 qar_quell_mashriqi_dissent_desc: "Ever since our conquest of Baghdad, the Arabs in our lands have continually been rebellious and uncooperative with us. Baghdad and its surrounding lands have required strict governance and continual military presence in order to be kept in line, and this approach is unsustainable. We must ensure their cooperation, whether by force or persuasion."

 #Events
 FU_QQ_Events.1.t: "The Three Brothers"
 FU_QQ_Events.1.d: "Our Sultan finds himself stuck in a precarious position with his three most prominent sons. Hasan ‘Ali, the eldest and heir apparent, has already been imprisoned and banished by his father multiple times due to his disobedience and rebellious nature. His mother and various nobles support him, however, and would certainly be likely to rebel to aid him in the event of his disinheritance.\nPir Budaq, Jahan Shah’s middle son currently serves as the governor of Baghdad, where he patronizes the arts, inviting poets and calligraphers from all around Persia and the Levant, revitalizing Baghdad’s position as a capital of the arts. He governs well, though is just as prone to disobedience as his elder brother, and with his power base in Baghdad he looms as a threat should his father decide to keep Hasan ‘Ali as his chosen heir.\nThe youngest of the three, Mirza Yusuf, is also the most obscure. He has very little influence or power in court, but enjoys the support of Pir Ali Beg, the Sultan’s amir-al-umara. Should Mirza Yusuf come to the throne, he would certainly have the support of the army, but his skill as a ruler remains unknown." 
 FU_QQ_Events.1.a: "The throne rightfully belongs to Hasan..." 
 FU_QQ_Events.1.b: "...but his incompetence will bring our downfall."
 FU_QQ_Events.1.c: "The third way is the safest."
 FU_QQ_Events.2.t: "Alvand Mirza - Governor of Mosul"
 FU_QQ_Events.2.d: "Mosul, one of our most important cities, has recently lost its Governor, and our Sultan’s nephew, Alvand Mirza, seems to be a good choice for the position. His skill at commanding men means that he’s most certainly qualified, however Jahan Shah and others at court worry that his ties with Uzun Hasan of the Aq Qoyunlu might put his loyalty in question should we go to war with the White Sheep. Our Sultan additionally fears that the government may succumb to nepotism, should so many important roles be filled by his close family members."
 FU_QQ_Events.2.b: "We can't allow nepotism in our government!"
 FU_QQ_Events.2.g: "Grant him the post."
 FU_QQ_Events.3.t: "Alvand Mirza's Flight" 
 FU_QQ_Events.3.d: "A black day for our dynasty as our esteemed Sultan's nephew Alvand Mirza has betrayed our trust and raised his flag in rebellion! In open defiance of our authority, he has fled to Mosul where coins have been struck and prayers have been recited in his name as he calls on his follows to march towards Tabriz. While God is sure to grant us victory, his treachery casts a long shadow over our magnanimous rule and it is clear that the time to act is now." 
 FU_QQ_Events.3.a: "That blasted coward!"
 FU_QQ_Events.4.t: "In Search of Religious Pragmatism"
 FU_QQ_Events.4.d: "While none doubt our commitment to the faith and protection of the righteous in the name of Hazrat Ali and the Ahl al-Bayt we rule a diverse realm of Muslims and Christians alike. As it becomes ever clearer that we will be the masters of Persia so does the need for religious pragmatism. Following the examples of our forefathers, we will prove to the diverse peoples of this land that we will protect them so that they may prosper under our banner."
 FU_QQ_Events.4.a: "Turbulent times to test the strength of our faith..."
 FU_QQ_Events.5.t: "Grand Library of Baghdad" 
 FU_QQ_Events.5.d: "Baghdad is no longer the shell of its former self that the Mongol and Timurid conquests had left it, and it has once again returned to being a flourishing centre of trade and scholarly pursuits. Sponsored by our sultan, poets, scientists, calligraphers and engineers have begun contributing their works to a restored House of Wisdom, and even some texts previously thought lost have been transcribed and restored." 
 FU_QQ_Events.5.a: "We have restored dour ancestors' wisdom!"

 fu_royal_imam: "Royal Imam"
 fu_royal_imam_desc: "In the Shi'a context, an imam is not only presented as the man of God par excellence, but as participating fully in the names, attributes, and acts that theology usually reserves for God alone. Imams have a meaning more central to belief, referring to leaders of the community."

 swe_crown_of_norway_title: "Crown of Norway" 
 swe_crown_of_norway_desc: "For far too long have our brothers and sisters enjoyed independence from the Swedish crown. As the fires of revolution light up and we unshackle ourselves from our Danish overlords, the matter of the Norwegian crown becomes of grave importance to us. Securing it under our authority would only further expand our influence and assist future endeavours." 
 swe_stabilize_realm_title: "Stabilize the Realm" 
 swe_stabilize_realm_desc: "Wars can be profitable and good for expansion and defence against bloodthirsty neighbours. However, our people yearn the taste of a simple and quiet life. To that end we must strive to restore the balance of peace across the realm in order to solidify our rule."
 swe_sail_westwards_title: "Sail Westwards"

 swe_forefathers_land_title:"Forefathers Land"

 swe_lund_university_title: "Academia Carolina"
 swe_lund_university_desc: "The success of previous educational establishments is no secret in our realm. To expand them is no wishful task as it involves both the monetary supplement for such endeavours as well as the de facto prosperity of the local people. After all, no poor soul would opt for education when their houses aren't in order."
 swe_literary_publications_title: "Literary Publications" 
 swe_literary_publications_desc: "To accumulate expertise in our court is one thing, to cultivate genius and publish literary achievements is another. In order to further the prestige of our country and glorify our history, we need to fund our literary excursions as best we can."

 swe_break_kalmar_union_title: "Break the Kalmar Union" 
 swe_break_kalmar_union_desc: "There was a time where the Danish crown brought authority, discipline, respect and prestige. However, Christopher's reign has proven without a doubt that Denmark is but a shadow of its former grandiose self. We shall march forward as a sovereign nation and carve our own course in history, free of overlords and petty nobles." 
 swe_cross_the_volkhov_title: "Cross the Volkhov" 
 swe_cross_the_volkhov_desc: "The city of Novgorod is a bastion of trade and prosperity. Despite not holding up to the splendor it enjoyed during the previous century, it remains as a vital center of trade for the region. March our troops forward across the Volkhov River and capture the city!"

 swe_maintain_ducal_balance_title: "Maintain Kingly Balance" 
 swe_maintain_ducal_balance_desc: "The internal politics of a Kingdom such as ours are no tranquil matter. Various factions, nobles, clerics and even powerful merchants strive to accumulate enough influence with our crown as a means to their ends. The Riksrag of the Estates is a valuable tool for the King to legislate, curb the power of the Estates or broker internal political deals with each Estate." 
 swe_introduce_indelningsverket_title: "Indelningsverket"
 swe_introduce_indelningsverket_desc: "The call to subsidise Sweden's first standing army has grown louder over the turbulent events of the 16th century. To that end, the Kings of Sweden, spearheaded by Gustav Vasa himself, came up with Sweden's allotment system. In detail, one out of every citizens signed up to serve, while the other 9 took care of him and his equipment. The state provided each soldier with ample land to cultivate and sustain himself in-between each war, resulting in an unprecedented amount of troops for a country as sparsely populated as ours." 
 swe_carolean_infantry_title: "Carolean Infantry" 
 swe_carolean_infantry_desc: "The struggle of Catholicism against the Protestantism and the Reformed faiths shall give birth to the ultimate soldier.

 swe_revive_ledungen_title: "Revive the Ledungen" 
 swe_revive_ledungen_desc: "Let us revive the statute of Ledungen, a form of conscription to organise coastal fleets for seasonal excursions and in defence of the realm.

Perhaps if we earn the favour of the Kingdom's strongest coin brokers, they could assist in and amplify our endeavours?" 
 swe_secure_neva_title: "Secure Neva" 
 swe_secure_neva_desc: "The cold port of Neva lies at the banks of one of the most valuable rivers in terms of its trade value, which coincidentally shares the city's name. Securing it would not only legitimize further conquest but would also greatly expand our mercantile reach in the region."

 swe_dominate_baltic_title: "Dominate the Baltic" 
 swe_dominate_baltic_desc: "The trade and goods flow that marches through the markets of Krakow and Novgorod makes a brief stop in the vendors of the various Baltic cities.

 swe_border_the_empire_desc: "The Holy Roman Empire is a major neighbour on our southern Border. We should tread carefully, as upsetting them might have dire consequences.

 swe_establish_kontore_title: "Establish Kontoret"

 swe_trade_port_riga_title: "Trade Port of Riga" 
 swe_trade_port_riga_desc: "During the 14th century, Riga prospered as an associate of the famous Hanseatic League. However, after the League's influence waned and faded away, they were briefly a puppet of the Habsburgs under the Free City status of protections and privileges. This allowed them to flourish and develop into an important commercial centre of the Baltic, a centre that would only further increase our influence and coin on the region." 
 swe_church_sweden_title: "Church of Sweden"
 swe_church_sweden_desc: "Shortly after Sweden converted to Catholicism, our country became a beacon of faith in Scandinavia through our exemplary display of fervour and piety.

 FU_Sweden_Events.1.t: "Svenska & Norska Unionen"
 FU_Sweden_Events.1.d: "Sweden and Norway had been united under the same crown on two previous occasions: from 1319 to 1343 and again briefly from in the 15th Century  in opposition to Christian of Oldenburg who was elected king of the Kalmar Union by the Danes. During the following centuries, Norway remained united with Denmark in close union, nominally as one kingdom, but in reality reduced to the status of a mere province ruled by Danish kings from their capital, Copenhagen. \nHowever, recent developments such as the destruction of our capital and the apparent weakness of the Danish Crown have led to Sweden pressing their claim on our throne yet again." 
 FU_Sweden_Events.1.a: "It would be wise to accept this fate."
 FU_Sweden_Events.1.b: "We shall die free men!"
 FU_Sweden_Events.2.t: "Sweden's First University"
 FU_Sweden_Events.2.d: "As with most medieval universities, Uppsala University initially grew out of an ecclesiastical center. The archbishopric of Uppsala had been one of the most important sees in Sweden proper since Christianity first spread to this region in the ninth century. Uppsala had also long been a hub for regional trade, and had contained settlements dating back into the deep Middle Ages. \nAs was also the case with most medieval universities, Uppsala had initially been chartered through a papal bull. Uppsala's bull, which granted the university its corporate rights, was issued by Pope Sixtus IV in 1477, and established a number of provisions. Among the most important of these was that the university was officially given the same freedoms and privileges as the University of Bologna. This included the right to establish the four traditional faculties of theology, law (Canon Law and Roman law), medicine, and philosophy, and to award the bachelor's, master's, licentiate, and doctoral degrees. The archbishop of Uppsala was also named as the university's Chancellor, and was charged with maintaining the rights and privileges of the university and its members." 
 FU_Sweden_Events.2.a: "Let us fund the university!" 
 FU_Sweden_Events.2.b: "This money is best spent in clerical studies."
 FU_Sweden_Events.3.t: "Lund Universitet" 
 FU_Sweden_Events.3.d: "The city of Lund has a long history as a center for learning and was the ecclesiastical center and seat of the archbishop of Denmark. A cathedral school (the Katedralskolan) for the training of clergy was established in 1085 and is today Scandinavia's oldest school. \nThe university traces its roots back to 1425, when a Franciscan studium generale (a medieval university) was founded in Lund next to the Lund Cathedral (with baccalaureate degree started in 1438), making it the oldest institution of higher education in Scandinavia followed by studia generalia in Uppsala in 1477 and Copenhagen in 1479. After Sweden won Scania from Denmark in the 1658 Treaty of Roskilde, the university was founded in 1666 on the location of the old studium generale next to Lund Cathedral. \n\nAfter the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658, the Scanian lands came under the possession of the Swedish Crown, which founded the University in 1666 as a means of making Scania Swedish by educating teachers in Swedish and culturally integrate the Scania region with Sweden. The university was named Academia Carolina after Charles X Gustav of Sweden until the late 19th century when Lund University became the widespread denomination. It was the fifth university under the Swedish king, after Uppsala University (1477), the University of Tartu (1632, now in Estonia), the Academy of Åbo (1640, now in Finland), and the University of Greifswald (founded 1456; Swedish 1648–1815, now in Germany). \nThe university was at its founding granted four faculties: Law, Theological, Medicine and Philosophy. They were the cornerstones, and for more than 200 years this system was in effect. Towards the end of the 17th century, the number of students hovered around 100. Some notable professors in the early days were Samuel Pufendorf, a juridical historian; and Canutus Hahn and Kristian Papke in philosophy." 
 FU_Sweden_Events.3.a: "Ad utrumque paratus!"
 FU_Sweden_Events.4.t: "A Description of the Northern Peoples" 
 FU_Sweden_Events.4.d: "The Swedish scholar and prelate, Olaus Magnus (1490-1557), last Catholic archbishop of Uppsala, lived the latter half of his life in exile. His devotion to his country and his people never faltered, nor his determination to give them a glorious place on the European cultural map by his writings. On his justly famous Carta Marina, published in Venice in 1539, he promised a fuller account of the North and its marvels. This he accomplished in January 1555 when he issued from his own press in Rome his magnificent Historia de Gentibus Septenrionalibus. This quarto volume of 815 pages, divided into 22 books and a total of 778 chapters, was lavishly illustrated with some 480 woodcuts, most of them closely relevant to the technical matters discussed by the author. The book was an immediate success, and half a dozen editions appeared in the century after Olaus’s death. It became even better known in an epitome published in Antwerp in 1558, which was also frequently reprinted and translated. This appeared in English in 1658, but it is only with the present version, complete with illustrations, that the whole work is made available to the English-reading world. It is indeed only the second full translation to appear in modern times, preceded a Swedish version published in four parts between 1909 and 1925. There is little history in the sense of chronological narrative in Olaus Magnus’s Historia. It is rightly regarded as an ethnographic essay on an encyclopaedic scale, touching on a vast variety of topics, snowflakes and sea-serpents, elks and artillery, sables and saltpetre, watermills and werewolves. Much of it was culled from ancient authorities- it was a matter of patriotic pride to identify the Swedes as the only legitimate descendants of the Goths- but much of it was derived from the author’s personal observations, especially those made on his early travels in North Sweden." 
 FU_Sweden_Events.4.a: "I can't wait for the sequel!"
 FU_Sweden_Events.5.t: "Riksdag of the Estates" 
 FU_Sweden_Events.5.d: "Riksdag of the Estates is the name used for the Estates of Sweden when they were assembled. Until its dissolution in 1866, the institution was the highest authority in Sweden next to the King. It was a Diet made up of the Four Estates, which historically were the lines of division in Swedish society: \nClergy \nNobles \nBurghers \nFarmers \nThe Diet is a powerful tool and it would be wise for us to carefully navigate the internal politics of our nation. During Sweden's entire history, there have been a number of important assemblies ranging from times where the King had no power, to times where the King had all the power. \nThus, whichever authority we choose to support, let us do so while holding the good of the country in mind." 
 FU_Sweden_Events.5.a: "Support the clerical estates."
 FU_Sweden_Events.5.b: "Our interest lie with our merchants."
 FU_Sweden_Events.5.c: "Let us secure the support of the nobility, instead."
 FU_Sweden_Events.5.e: "We need not depend on the old institutions!"
 FU_Sweden_Events.6.t: "Karoliner" 
 FU_Sweden_Events.6.d: "Indeed, the Carolean Infantry employed new, never-before-seen tactics in the battlefield. \nAccording to army regulations of 1694 and 1701, the infantry attack operated as follows: In four ranks with gaps, a Swedish battalion would march "smoothly and slowly" towards the enemy lines, braving enemy fire that often started at a distance of approximately 100 metres. The Swedish soldiers were told not to fire until "you could see the whites in the enemies eyes", a range of roughly 50 metres. When the marching drums stopped the two rear ranks would fill the gaps within the two foremost ranks and fire a salvo, then draw their swords. The two rear ranks would then move back to their previous position, and the two foremost ranks would close the gaps in their lines, after which the battalion would resume their attack. The two foremost ranks would discharge their muskets in a final volley when they were within range to charge—a distance of roughly 20 metres. At these ranges, the powerful muskets usually felled many enemy troops, having a great physical and psychological impact on opponents. Directly after the final volley, the Caroleans charged the enemy ranks with pikes, bayonets, and rapiers. Note that the pikes were used as an offensive weapon; in close combat, they had the advantage over their foes' weapons due to their long reach. Often, complete ranks of enemies fled before physical contact was made, frightened by the long pikes and the fact that the Swedish battalions had previously calmly withstood their fire" 
 FU_Sweden_Events.6.a: "Hakkaa päälle!"
 FU_Sweden_Events.7.t: "The Farms of Sweden"
 FU_Sweden_Events.7.d: "Our country is very unique in the sense that we never experienced extensive feudalism. Nobles never really got a hold of our lands as they did in other parts of Europe. However, we stand at a very important crossroads for our nation. Having survived the Agrarian Crisis we must decide whether we will grant land to the nobles or leave it be at the hands of the people."
 FU_Sweden_Events.7.a: "The peasantry must own their lands."
 FU_Sweden_Events.7.b: "Reaffirm the status of the nobility."
 FU_Sweden_Events.8.t: "The Sound Dues of Sweden" 
 FU_Sweden_Events.8.d: "Originally instituted in 1429 by King Eric of Pomerania, the Dues operated as toll stations for ships sailing towards and through the former Danish capital. With Denmark's demise, however, the Dues have fallen under our administration and thus  it is up to us to decide how best to utilize such a powerful profiteering tool." 
 FU_Sweden_Events.8.a: "Impose new Sound Dues."
 FU_Sweden_Events.8.b: "Let us create a market of free trade instead."
 FU_Sweden_Events.9.t: "Holstein's Position in the Empire"
 FU_Sweden_Events.9.d: "The Swedish army marched into Holstein, a de-facto seat Prince of the Holy Roman Empire we have sworn to uphold and protect. Despite outside pressure they refused to grant the people of the province autonomy under the Empire's authority. Perhaps it is time the head of the Holy Roman Empire intervenes directly, lest we risk the sovereignty of the Empire and our legitimacy." 
 FU_Sweden_Events.9.a: "Demand Holstein's return!"
 FU_Sweden_Events.9.b: "Let us delegate their entry in the Empire!"
 FU_Sweden_Events.10.t: "Imperial Diplomacy" 
 FU_Sweden_Events.10.d: "The Emperor has decreed that Sweden, due to its military might and proximity to the Empire, whilst maintaining a monopoly on the Baltic trade markets, shall be given the unique opportunity to join the Confederation of Germanic Princes commonly known as the Holy Roman Empire. This is of course a diplomatic move, opting to avoid potential destablization and war on the Empire's northern front." 
 FU_Sweden_Events.10.a: "Let us join the Holy Roman Empire!"
 FU_Sweden_Events.10.b: "Draw genitalia on the letter and send it back!"
 FU_Sweden_Events.11.t: "Administrating the Pomeranian Coast" 
 FU_Sweden_Events.11.d: "Various disgraced nobles of the former Duchy of Pomerania have come to our court to beg for the partial autonomy and restoration of their lands. They argue that the people of Pomerania would be far more cooperative should they be ruled under a familiar banner and coat of arms. To that end they pledge their allegience to the Swedish Crown in exchange for immediate vassalization." 
 FU_Sweden_Events.11.a: "Restore the Duchy of Pomerania under our flag!" 
 FU_Sweden_Events.11.b: "Bah, loot their estates!"
 FU_Sweden_Events.12.t: "The Svenska-Livland Dominion"
 FU_Sweden_Events.12.d: "Various disgraced nobles of the former Order of Livonia have come to our court to beg for the partial autonomy and restoration of their lands. They argue that the people of Estonia would be far more cooperative should they be ruled under a familiar banner and coat of arms. To that end they pledge their allegience to the Swedish Crown in exchange for immediate vassalization."
 FU_Sweden_Events.12.a: "They will serve the Swedish Crown!"
 FU_Sweden_Events.12.b: "Our lands, our rules."
 FU_Sweden_Events.13.t: "Gustav Vasa Bible" 
 FU_Sweden_Events.13.d: "The Gustav Vasa Bible is the common name of the Swedish Bible translation published in 1540–41. The full title is as appears on the right: Biblia / Thet är / All then Helgha Scrifft / på Swensko. The translation into English reads: "The Bible / That is / All the Holy Scripture / In Swedish". \nThe men behind the translation were Laurentius Andreae and the Petri brothers Olaus and Laurentius. Of them, Archbishop Laurentius is regarded as the main contributor. However, had the work not been commissioned by the Swedish King Gustav Vasa, who had in effect broken with the Pope in Rome in the 1520s, the work would not have been possible. \nThe Bible follows the German translation by Martin Luther from 1526 closely, not only in language, but in the fonts used and the typography as a whole. The Danish version, printed a few years earlier, also did this. \nThe Bible established the use of the Swedish language. It established a uniform spelling of words, particularly the infinitive ending -a instead of the more Danish-sounding -e, and defined the use of the vowels å, ä and ö. It did use th for /ð/, as in English, as is apparent on the title page; but this eventually changed to d." 
 FU_Sweden_Events.13.a: "Spread the word!"
 FU_Sweden_Events.14.t: "Gustav I Vasa" 
 FU_Sweden_Events.14.d: "The man who became pivotal in our independence struggle, Gustav Vasa became the first Swedish King in a long line of brilliant and pioneering monarchs that propelled Sweden in the foreground of Great Power diplomacy. " 
 FU_Sweden_Events.14.a: "The throne is his."
 FU_Sweden_Events.14.b: "We shouldn't disturb the status quo!"
 FU_Sweden_Events.15.t: "The Lion of the North" 
 FU_Sweden_Events.15.d: "Originally inaugurated in 1611, Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden@SWE became known for his brilliant governance of the nation and is credited for the rise of Sweden as a great European power. During his reign, Sweden became one of the primary military forces in Europe during the Thirty Years' War, helping to determine the political and religious balance of power in Europe. He was formally and posthumously given the name Gustavus Adolphus the Great by the Riksdag of the Estates in 1634. \nHe is often regarded as one of the greatest military commanders in modern history, with use of an early form of combined arms. His contributions to Sweden's rise in power included reformation of the administrative structure. For example, he began parish registration of the population, so that the central government could more efficiently tax and conscript the people. His actions in the fields of economic reform, trade, modernization, and the creation of a modern bureaucracy were as significant as his actions in war. His domestic reforms, starting from a medieval economy and society, were the foundation for his victories in Germany as well as the creation and survival of the Swedish Empire. \nHe is widely commemorated by Protestants in Europe as the main defender of their cause during the Thirty Years' War, with multiple churches, foundations and other undertakings named after him, including the Gustav-Adolf-Werk. He became a symbol of Swedish pride."  
 FU_Sweden_Events.15.a: "Lion come forth!"
 FU_Sweden_Events.15.b: "We have no need for extravagancy!"
 FU_Sweden_Events.16.t: "The Dalecarlian Rebellions"
 FU_Sweden_Events.16.d: "Economic crisis occurred after the Swedish war of liberation because of the trade monopoly the king had granted the Hanseatic Lübeck in exchange for their support in recapturing the capital during the war. The discontent was used by two Catholic priests, former Bishop Peder Jakobsson of Västerås, a follower of Sten Sture the Younger, and Knut Mickelsson, who opposed the inclinations of Lutheranism which the king had displayed as early as the 16th Century, who stirred up the emotions against the king and for the Sture family in the province." 
 FU_Sweden_Events.16.a: "This is madness!"
 FU_Sweden_Events.17.t: "The Sture Murders" 
 FU_Sweden_Events.17.d: "Rising tensions between the King and the nobility have culminated in our monarch firmly believing that the nobles were planning to usurp the throne and violently depose the current authority. Given the stresses of administrating the vast Swedish lands, the King, suspecting of imminent treason ordered the death of 5 prominent noblemen of the Sture family. Acting on madness and fear and deeply apologetic about his actions he sought the forgiveness of the Sture family who responded by demanding large sums of coin as well as land." 
 FU_Sweden_Events.17.a: "Compensate the victims and pursue seclusion." 
 FU_Sweden_Events.17.b: "Drive them out of our land!"
 FU_Sweden_Events.18.t: "The Invasion of Brandenburg" 
 FU_Sweden_Events.18.d: "Multiple successes in the Germanic front have led to the Swedish military commanders pressing higher command to push deeper towards Berlin given the undefended nature of the German capital. Pushing forward with this war may yield us with even more land deeper in Holy Roman territory while it may also trigger a defensive coalition against us which might lead to a protracted war." 
 FU_Sweden_Events.18.a: "The time to strike is now!" 
 FU_Sweden_Events.18.b: "We will pursue more diplomatic alternatives."
 FU_Sweden_Events.19.t: "Swedish East India Company"
 FU_Sweden_Events.19.d: "The Swedish East India Company (Swedish: Svenska Ostindiska Companiet or SOIC) was founded in Gothenburg, Sweden, in the 18th Century for the purpose of conducting trade with China and the Far East. The venture was inspired by the success of the Dutch East India Company and the British East India Company. This made Gothenburg a European center of trade in eastern products . The main goods were silk, tea, furniture, porcelain, precious stones and other distinctive luxury items. Trade with China saw the arrival of some new customs in Sweden. The Chinese cultural influence increased, and tea, rice, arrack and new root vegetables started appearing in Swedish homes. It grew to become the largest trading company in Sweden during the 18th century, a total of 132 expeditions were carried out with 37 different ships." 
 FU_Sweden_Events.19.a: "Let there be profit!"
 FU_Sweden_Events.21.t: "Expedition to Lapland" 
 FU_Sweden_Events.21.d: "The Expedition to Lapland, the northernmost region in Sweden, by Carl Linnaeus in 1732 was an important part of his scientific career. Linnaeus departed from Uppsala and travelled clockwise around the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia over the course of six months, making major inland incursions from Umeå, Luleå and Tornio. His observations became the basis of his book Flora Lapponica (1737) in which Linnaeus’ ideas about nomenclature and classification were first used in a practical way. Linnaeus kept a journal of his expedition which was first published posthumously as an English translation called Lachesis Lapponica: A Tour in Lapland (1811). \nHe returned from his six-month-long, over 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) expedition on 10 October, having gathered and observed many plants, birds and rocks. Although Lapland was a region with limited biodiversity, Linnaeus described about a hundred previously undescribed plants. The details of his discoveries became the basis of his book Flora Lapponica. Linnaeus's account of the journey, Iter Lapponicum was translated into English by James Edward Smith and published in 1811 as Lachesis Lapponica: A Tour in Lapland." 
 FU_Sweden_Events.21.a: "Nature is fascinating!"
 FU_Sweden_Events.22.t: "Civil Code of the Swedish Realm" 
 FU_Sweden_Events.22.d: "Administrating the Baltic lands under our jurisdiction is no easy task. To that end let us culminate our best minds in the realm on the largest legal project the country has ever seen. A legislative work that includes jursiprudence about every aspect of life in Sweden, unified and widely distributed across all provinces, closely followed and honestly practiced by judges throughout the nation!" 
 FU_Sweden_Events.22.a: "A new era for our Baltic territories!"
 FU_Sweden_Events.23.t: "Bollhuset Theater" 
 FU_Sweden_Events.23.d: "Bollhuset, also called Stora Bollhuset (The Big Ball House), Bollhusteatern (Ball House Theater), and Gamla Bollhuset (Old Ball House) at various times, was the name of the first theater in Stockholm, Sweden; it was the first Swedish theater and the first real theater building in the whole of Scandinavia. The name "Bollhuset" means "The Ball House", and it was built in 1627 for ball sports and used in this way for forty years. The name Lejonkulan, however, was, in fact, the name of a different building, which was also used by the same theater in the 17th century. \nBollhuset was the scene of a long series of most important events in the history of the theater in the city and in the history of Swedish theater. Between 1667 and 1792 it was used as a theater until it was demolished in 1793; between 1737 and 1754, the first national theater was located here; in 1773–1782 the Royal Swedish Opera (and thereby also the Royal Swedish Ballet) was located here; in 1783–1792 the French theater of Stockholm was housed here; in 1787 the second national theater was re-founded in the building; and from 1788 to 1792 it was the home of the Royal Dramatic Theatre." 
 FU_Sweden_Events.23.a: "Such an elegant display of culture and sophistication!"
 FU_Sweden_Events.24.t: "Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences"
 FU_Sweden_Events.24.d: "The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (Swedish: Kungliga Vetenskapsakademien) is one of the royal academies of Sweden. Founded on June 2, 1739, it is an independent, non-governmental scientific organization which takes special responsibility for promoting the natural sciences and mathematics and strengthen their influence in society, whilst endeavouring to promote the exchange of ideas between various disciplines. \n\nThe goals of the academy are to be a forum where researchers meet across subject boundaries, to offer a unique environment for research, and to provide support to younger researchers. Famously, the academy would later go on to host the world-renowned Nobel Prize Awards."
 FU_Sweden_Events.24.a: "För efterkommande!"
 FU_Sweden_Events.25.t: "Anders Celsius and the Celsius Temperature Scale"
 FU_Sweden_Events.25.d: "In 1730, Celsius published the Nova Methodus distantiam solis a terra determinandi (New Method for Determining the Distance from the Earth to the Sun). His research also involved the study of auroral phenomena, which he conducted with his assistant Olof Hiorter, and he was the first to suggest a connection between the aurora borealis and changes in the magnetic field of the Earth.\n\nIn 1738, he published the De observationibus pro figura telluris determinanda (Observations on Determining the Shape of the Earth). Celsius's participation in the Lapland expedition won him much respect in Sweden with the government and his peers, and played a key role in generating interest from the Swedish authorities in donating the resources required to construct a new modern observatory in Uppsala." 
 FU_Sweden_Events.25.a: "A very hot man of science!"
 FU_Sweden_Events.26.t: "Svea Rikes Historia"
 FU_Sweden_Events.26.d: "Olof von Dalin (29 August 1708 – 12 August 1763) was a Swedish nobleman, poet, historian and courtier. He was an influential literary figure of the Swedish Enlightenment. \n\nHis didactic epos of Svenska Friheten appeared in 1742. Hitherto, Addison and Alexander Pope had been his models. In this work he draws his inspiration from Thomson, whose poem, Liberty, he emulated. In 1742, he was made a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Dalin started publishing his Swedish history, Svea Rikes Historia in 1747. He would die before this work was complete.\n\nHis position at court involved him in the queen's political intrigues, and separated him to a vexatious degree from the studies wherein he had hitherto been absorbed. He held the post of Tutor to the crown prince until 1756, when he was arrested on suspicion of taking part in the attempted coup d'état that year, and was tried for his life before the diet. He was acquitted, but was forbidden to show himself at court on any pretense. This period of exile, lasting until 1761, Dalin spent in the preparation of the third volume of his great historical work, the Svea Rikes historia, that related events up to the death of King Charles IX of Sweden in 1611. The first two volumes appeared in 1746-1750; the third, in two parts, in 1760-1762." 
 FU_Sweden_Events.26.a: "A celebrated account of our history!"
 FU_Sweden_Events.27.t: "The December Crisis" 
 FU_Sweden_Events.27.d: "The December Crisis, also known as Decemberkrisen,  was a political crisis which occurred in Sweden in December 1768 when the King of Sweden, demonstrated against his limited powers by refusing to sign state documents, thereby paralyzed the government and bringing about a new Riksdag of the Estates. \n\nIn December 1768, the king refused to sign state documents in protest to his limited power and on 15 December, the king formally resigned his throne in order to bring about the gathering of a new Riksdag, during which a reform to increase his capacity could be introduced. This created a difficult political situation, as he had thereby technically abdicated and the nation was in interregnum. The Hovpartiet, a political party backing the monarch, suggested that the crisis could be used to stage a coup to establish absolute monarchy. The queen opposed because she did not consider the time right for such a step and advocated negotiation with the Hats (party) and the Caps (party), but at this point, the Hovpartiet for the first time turned to the Crown Prince rather than the queen; however, the crisis could not be used for a coup because the Caps party broke an agreement." 
 FU_Sweden_Events.27.a: "I refuse!"
 FU_Sweden_Events.27.b: "Bend to the nobility."
 FU_Sweden_Events.28.t: "Societetsskolan i Göteborg för Döttrar"
 FU_Sweden_Events.d: "Societetsskolan i Göteborg för döttrar ('Society School for Daughters in Gothenburg') or simply Societetsskolan ('Society School'), was a Swedish girls' school managed by the congregation of the Moravian Church in Gothenburg from 1 November 1787 until 1857. It is referred to as the first girls' school in Sweden, because it was the first institution to provide serious academic secondary education to females. \n\nThe school is known under many different names. Because it was initially intended to serve the children of the Moravian congregation, it was called Brödraförsamlingens flickskola i Göteborg ('Girls' School of the Unity of the Brethren in Gothenburg') or Evangeliska Brödraförsamlingens flickskola i Göteborg ('Girls' School of the Unity of the Evangelical Brethren in Gothenburg'), but also, commonly, as Salsskolan ('Hall School'), because it was initially held in the prayer hall of the Moravian congregation."

 FU_Sweden_Events.30.d: "The Polish–Swedish union was a short-lived personal union between the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and the Kingdom of Sweden, when Sigismund III Vasa, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, was crowned King of Sweden in 1592. In 1599, after a civil war, he lost this crown and returned to Warsaw. \n\nHowever, the recent developments in Europe accompanied with our rise to power have given way to us laying claim on the throne of our former overlord."

You say, ‘but the idlers will eat meat without needing to.’ The answer is that these very same people fill themselves with even richer foods, which enflame them even more than the highly-seasoned highly-spiced meats...' \n\nThus, the debate over the dietary habits of Christians, sparked the beginning of the Reformation in Switzerland."

 FU_Switzerland_Events.1.t: "Manufacturing & Trading of Swiss Embroidery" 
 FU_Switzerland_Events.1.d: "St. Gallen embroidery, sometimes known as Swiss embroidery, is embroidery from the city and the region of St. Gallen, Switzerland. Around [GetYear], its embroidery production was the largest export branch of the Swiss economy with 18 percent of the overall export value. The Swiss embroidery factories will eventually come to produce more than 50 percent of the world production due to its workers' tremendous skills and trade secrets, for centuries." 
 FU_Switzerland_Events.1.a: "Darling, you look fabulous!"
 FU_Switzerland_Events.2.t: "Swiss Cheese" 
 FU_Switzerland_Events.2.d: "Said to be discovered around the Neolithic Age, the Swiss Cheese became one of the proudest products in the said region. It was first recorded by Pliny the Elder around the first century, which he describes as "Caseus Helveticus". Switzerland has been a cheese hub since the Middle Ages and, like many European countries, it has always taken its culinary reputation very seriously. And in many ways, that seriousness has actually hindered its international appeal. A heavily government-subsidized organization called the Swiss Cheese Union enjoyed complete control over both production and export throughout much of the industrialized 18th and 19th centuries, dictating in no uncertain terms exactly how, where, and when Switzerland’s cheeses could be made. In the name of economic virility, the Union threw practically all of its weight behind just three top-sellers out of the country’s many beloved heritage styles—earthy, nutty Gruyère; the fragrant, Parmesan-like Sbrinz, and Emmentaler, better known as “the one with the holes.” (Appenzeller, a semi-hard cheese used in fondue, would join the pack later.) This effectively rendered the unapproved varieties obsolete and gave the rest of the world a very narrow understanding of Swiss cheesemaking." 
 FU_Switzerland_Events.2.a: "Blessed are the cheesemakers!"
 FU_Switzerland_Events.3.t: "Treaty of Eternal Direction"
 FU_Switzerland_Events.3.d: "The Eternal Direction was a peace and alliance treaty that the eight towns of the Old Confederation concluded in [GetYear] with the Austrian Archduke . With this treaty, the military conflict between the House of Habsburg and the Swiss , which had been going on since 1291, ended for the time being. \n\nBoth parties had elected the French King as a mediator. The negotiations took place in Constance with the mediation of Bishop Hermann III. from Breitenlandenberg . A first version of the agreement was completed earlier this year, but it was not until several months later before the royal French mediator  was able to ratify the final version of the treaty."
 FU_Switzerland_Events.3.a: "For peace!"
 FU_Switzerland_Events.3.b: "We will never give up our territories to the Swiss!"
 FU_Switzerland_Events.4.t: "William Tell and Arnold von Winkelried"
 FU_Switzerland_Events.4.d: "William Tell and Arnold von Winkelried are folk heroes of Switzerland. According to the legend, Tell was an expert marksman with the crossbow who assassinated Albrecht Gessler, a tyrannical reeve of the Austrian dukes of the House of Habsburg positioned in Altdorf, in the canton of Uri. Tell's defiance and tyrannicide encouraged the population to open rebellion and a pact against the foreign rulers with neighbouring Schwyz and Unterwalden, marking the foundation of the Swiss Confederacy. \n\nArnold Winkelried's sacrifice, on the other hand, brought about the victory of the Old Swiss Confederacy in the Battle of Sempach (1386) over the army of the Habsburg Duke Leopold III of Austria. According to legend, the Swiss initially could not break the close ranks of the Habsburg pikemen. Winkelried cried: "I will open a passage into the line; protect, dear countrymen and confederates, my wife and children..." He then threw himself upon the Austrian pikes, taking some of them down with his body. This broke up the Austrian front, and made an opening through which the Swiss could attack." 
 FU_Switzerland_Events.4.a: "Our national spirit is unyielding!"
 FU_Switzerland_Events.5.t: "The Swiss Confederation" 
 FU_Switzerland_Events.5.d: "By the second half of the 14th century, the three original cantons had joined with the cantons of Glarus and Zug and the Lucerne, Zürich and Bern city states to form the "Old Confederacy" of eight states that existed until the end of the 15th century. The expansion led to increased power and wealth for the confederation. By the 1440s, the confederates controlled most of the territory south and west of the Rhine to the Alps and the Jura mountains, particularly after victories against the Habsburgs. \n\nDespite the fact that the Confederacy did not operate smoothly all the time, it served its purpose quite efficiently. In times of crisis, it gathered all the city-members together, under one banner, to defend the ideals of democracy and republican virtue. \n\nIt now befalls you to expand the Confederacy and protect your future brethren from outside foes. Good luck..." 
 FU_Switzerland_Events.5.a: "Let us move forward, together."
