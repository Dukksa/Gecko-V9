Our people must be one in aim, we will be like the Arab traders, spreading our faith and commerce wherever we can."

It was one of the world's most powerful empires of the early modern period, becoming known as 'the empire on which the sun never sets' and reached its maximum extent in the 18th century."

 persian_theocracy_desc:0 "After declaring our lands to be a bastion of Shi'ism, we must now launch a vigorous campaign to convert those who would oppose the true faith, ridding our kingdom of the Sunni population by either persuasion or force. Political and religious power will remain completely intertwined, and encapsulated in the person of the Shah."
 establish_qurchi_corps_reform:0 "Establish Qurchi Corps"
 establish_qurchi_corps_reform_desc:0 "The Qizilbash tribes are the core of our military strength, and their nobles already occupy the Office of the Sepahsalar. If we trust them to protect our kingdom, we should extend this trust to ourselves by establishing a permanent royal guard. Naturally, the newly created Office of the Qurchi-bashi will also need to be filled. Who better to command our royal guard than the same nobles who have led our armies?"
 foreign_ghilman_reform:0 "Enlist Ghilman"
 foreign_ghilman_reform_desc:0 "As we conquer deeper into the Caucasus, our lands have become full of Christian tribes and clans that we could put to good use if we gave them a place within our system of state. Their people consist of tough warriors and innovative thinkers. If we can convert them from their heathen ways, they could make excellent advisors, military officers, and act as local representatives. Most of all they could mobilize their kinsmen and provice us with a source of elite soldiers who could counter the immense influence of the Qizilbash in our armies and military command."

 qizilbash_in_officer_corps_reform_desc:0 "With the important military administrative position of the Office of the Qullar-bashi firmly in control of the Ghilman, the jealous Qizilbash have pushed for control of the Office of the Tupchi-bashi and the Office of the Tufangchi-bashi, commanders of our musketeer and artillery corps respectively. With the Qizilbash already having such power, it would be wise to appease them... for now."

 reforms_of_abbas_i_reform_desc:0 "Far too much power has been concentrated by the Qizilbash tribes, and we have become far too reliant on them for our military might. It is time to restructure the army. We should bolster our military with a greater emphasis on artillery and firearms, and shift the backbone of our armies from the untrustworthy Turkoman tribes to the Ghilman, who have become solely loyal to us.\n\nBeyond this, as our kingdom grows our lands have become home to many Christians. Despite our tradition of zealotry, it would be wise to show tolerance for their practices, if only to further integrate them and quell any spark of rebellion.\n\nHowever, it is not only the army and bureaucracy that need change, but our kingdom's economy as well. We will foster our diminishing trade back to health by reestablishing the security of our roads so that caravans may travel our lands unmolested."

 derbend_organization_reform:0 "Derbend Organization"
 derbend_organization_reform_desc:0 "Derbendjis were the most important and largest Ottoman military auxiliary constabulary units usually responsible for guarding important roads, bridges, fords or mountain passes. Usually, the population of an entire village near some important pass would be assigned with Derbendji status in exchange for tax exemptions. By rehabilitating the Derbendjis, the Ottomans released conventional military units from routine internal duties, such as guarding and repairing roads and bridges."
 establish_auxiliary_support_system_reform:0 "Establish Auxiliary Support System"
 establish_auxiliary_support_system_reform_desc:0 "The Ottoman armies were distinguished from their contemporaries not just by the numerical predominance of its military forces but by the thoroughness of the administrative backup and general support that maintained them in the field. The Ottoman army had a corps to prepare the road, a corps to pitch the tents ahead, a corps to bake the bread. The Djebedji Corps, a subunit of the Ottoman artillery corps, functioned as part of the Janissaries, who also maintained its own medical auxiliaries."

 reform_the_janissaries_reform_desc:0 "Despite an early adoption of firearm technology, the Janissaries have become increasingly resistant to changes, often rising in rebellion when feeling threatened by outside influence, leaving our infantry in a weakened state as Western nations modernize their militaries. We must enforce a change and reorganize the Janissary Corps, or risk falling indefinitely behind our rivals."
