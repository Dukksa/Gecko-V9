 echo.6.t:0 "New Player Readme"
 echo.6.d:0 "There are many changes in this mod, but the main ones are:\n\nBeing over Governing Capacity now has severe penalties. Being under Governing Capacity gives a scaling -10% Development Cost at max.\n\nKent and Calais is now a land connection. Gibraltar and Ceuta is now a land connection. Tajura and Mukha is now a land connection. Hormuz and Mogostan and Qawasim are now land connections.\n\nHordes have 100% Cav Ratio and 100 Horde Unity for the duration of the first age, after which their Horde Unity will begin ticking down and their max Cav Ratio will be 75%. Hordes will need to reform into one of their formables to maintain their stability.\n\nSeveral Building Slot Decisions added which show inefficient buildings in the province.\n\nMercenaries are now hired via decision and you have a Mercenary Forcelimit that is separate to your Land Forcelimit Modifier. You can increase it by increasing your development and taking ideas that give Mercenary Forcelimit.\n\nThe Merchant Guild Financial Demand privilege now can be revoked for -10 Burgher Loyalty after cooldown.\n\nEvery loan you have reduces your Mercenary Forcelimit by -0.6%. Every % of inflation reduces your Mercenary Forcelimit by -2% and Mercenary Discipline by -1%.\n\nEstate loyalty equilibrium is now 50 but Estate Privileges no longer give loyalty.\n\nYou can recruit any advisor using the "Recruit X Advisor" type decision.\n\nYou can create trade centres using the "Create a Trade Centre" decision. Trade Centres now scale to level 4. \n\nYou can improve Wool, Grain, Naval Supplies or Livestock provinces if developed sufficiently using the "Issue Provincial Assessment" decision.\n\nIf you break alliance with a country, you cannot re-ally it until the "Broke Alliance" opinion modifier has ticked down to 0. This is usually 5 years, but is effected by Improve Relations. \n\nMilitary Advisor Events have been locked until Miltary Tech 9 is unlocked and can be fired once every 100 years.\n\nEstate mana privileges have been completely removed from the game and you now start at 5 crownland.\n\nThe Nobility estate privilege: Force Conscription now gives you 2 Yearly Manpower at 100 Influence.\n\nEvery country can explore via decision and colonise after Dip Tech 6, after which the New World may be colonised.\n\nArmy Tradition now provides 15% Forcelimit and Mercenary Forcelimit at 100, scaling with tradition.\n\nMilitary Technology bonuses are more spread out over the course of the game.\n\n\nBuildings:\nArmoury building added that gives +3 Forcelimit and requires 30 Development in province to be built. Buildings now give a small -1.25% Dev Cost per building up to 6 buildings max. Courthouses reduce the terrain development penalty by -25%.\n\nRegimental Camps provide an extra bonus on Grain provinces. Barracks provide a flat 250 Manpower on livestock provinces. Impressment Offices now give +120% Manpower and 250% Sailors if the whole state is 30 development, 10 Manpower Dev, has barracks and is prosperous. Please note if you are using any mods that increase interface size, you may not be able to see the Armoury building.\n\n\n\nTriggered Modifiers:\nThere are several Critical Provinces which give military bonuses for owning. Hover over this decision requirements to highlight their locations.\n\nImperial Ambition: Gives Strong Military and Economic bonuses for having 0 Allies.\n\nRising Power: Gives Strong Economic bonuses for countries under 400 Total Development.\n\nWar Chest: If you have 1.25x your yearly income, you will receive military bonuses during war until the Age of Absolutism.\n\nSplendid Court: Gives a small Economic Bonus in Age of Discovery if you have at least one level 3 advisor."\n\nImperial Dominance: Gives -0.5 AT and NT decay to the Top 3 Great Powers."\n\nIf you have this modifier for 10 years and you have remained under your Governing Capacity for the duration, you will receive a further 400 Governing Capacity and +1 Accepted Cultures until the end of the game."
