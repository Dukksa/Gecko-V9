  GZM_4_desc:0 "Discipline, preparation and training are what win battles. With this in mind our commanders have successfully begun to pioneer elaborate new tactics and a new army organization. Let us make good use of these innovations by dividing our warriors into regiments and then let them train regularly with their bows, assegais, daggers and axes. Practice will also allow them to fight in formation without fear, defeating much more numerous enemies."
  GZM_5_desc:0 "By Introducing a new System of Conscription we will ensure that we will have enough men to fill our ranks."

Let us support this group over all others by baring Swahili traders as well as European fortune seekers from trading within our borders."
